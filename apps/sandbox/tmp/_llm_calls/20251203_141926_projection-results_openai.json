  "response": "## Economy\u2011wide emissions trajectories\n\nAcross all scenarios, net emissions decline from a common 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, but with markedly different end\u2011states by 2050.\n\nUnder **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway)**, total net emissions fall by 117.8%, from 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050. This implies the economy becomes a net sink before 2050, with cumulative reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to the baseline.\n\nUnder **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)**, emissions are almost fully abated, decreasing by 99.1% to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050. This represents a total reduction of 397.51 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to the 2025 level.\n\nIn contrast, the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** delivers only a 48.8% reduction by 2050, leaving residual emissions of 205.41 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. The 2050 emissions gap between Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol\u2011House\u2011View is therefore 276.9 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, underscoring the scale of additional abatement required for a 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned outcome.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 for each scenario, showing deep decarbonisation and net\u2011negative emissions in Ampol\u20111p5DS, near\u2011complete abatement in Ampol\u20112p5DS, and substantial residual emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View.*\n\n## Sectoral contributions to emissions reduction\n\nAll scenarios rely heavily on decarbonising power supply, with **Power Generation** providing the single largest contribution to abatement. By 2050, reductions from power reach approximately:\n\n- **\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in both Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol\u20112p5DS; and  \n- **\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View.\n\nIn **Ampol-1p5DS**, total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e are driven by:\n\n- **Industry** (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e);  \n- **Transport** (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e); and  \n- significant contributions from **Land Use**, **Buildings**, and **Carbon Dioxide Removal**, which together push the system into net\u2011negative territory.\n\nIn **Ampol-2p5DS**, reductions are more evenly shared between:\n\n- Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e);  \n- **Land Use** (\u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e); and  \n- Industry (\u201197.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), with more moderate cuts in Transport and Buildings.  \n\nThe **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** pathway achieves a more modest total reduction of 195.63 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050. While Power Generation (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) still decarbonise substantially, **Transport** emissions fall only by 21.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, and **Land Use** becomes a net source, increasing emissions by **33.58 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e**. This deterioration in land\u2011based emissions is a key factor explaining the weaker national outcome relative to the climate\u2011aligned scenarios.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by 2050 relative to a 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, highlighting the dominance of power\u2011sector abatement across all scenarios and contrasting land\u2011use outcomes, especially the net increase in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View.*\n\n## Electricity demand and implications for the energy system\n\nThe decarbonisation pathways are closely linked to changes in electricity demand, reflecting the extent of electrification of end\u2011use sectors and the deployment of new technologies such as hydrogen production and direct air capture.\n\nFrom a 2025 baseline of **355.36 TWh**, electricity consumption increases in all scenarios:\n\n- **Ampol-1p5DS**: demand rises by **186.9%** to **1,019.51 TWh** in 2050. This is the highest electricity use, consistent with widespread electrification of transport, industry and buildings, and additional load from negative\u2011emissions technologies.  \n- **Ampol-2p5DS**: demand grows by **119.7%** to **780.55 TWh** in 2050, reflecting significant but less extensive electrification compared with Ampol\u20111p5DS.  \n- **Ampol-House-View**: demand doubles (**+102.5%**) to **719.75 TWh** by 2050, mainly due to incremental electrification without the full deployment of deep\u2011decarbonisation technologies.\n\nBy 2050, electricity consumption in Ampol\u20111p5DS exceeds that in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View by **299.8 TWh**, implying the need for substantially greater low\u2011emissions generation capacity and associated network infrastructure in a 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned transition (explored further in the Power System and Sectoral Pathways sections).\n\n![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector from 2025 to 2050, showing the higher and more rapid growth in demand under the climate\u2011aligned scenarios, particularly Ampol\u20111p5DS, relative to the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View reference.*"
