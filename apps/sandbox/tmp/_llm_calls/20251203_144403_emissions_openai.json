  "response": "### Economy-wide emissions trajectory\n\nAcross all scenarios, total net emissions fall substantially from 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025, but the depth of decarbonisation diverges markedly by 2050. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies a net\u2011negative economy. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** achieves a 99.1% reduction to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, effectively reaching net zero around mid\u2011century. In contrast, **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** only reduces emissions by 48.8%, to 205.41 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, leaving 2050 emissions 276.9 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol-1p5DS.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions from 2025 to 2050 by major sector for each scenario, showing the pace and depth of decarbonisation across the economy.*\n\n### Sectoral contributions to emissions reduction\n\nIn 2025, economy\u2011wide emissions are dominated by power, industry and transport. All scenarios rely heavily on these sectors for abatement, but with differing ambition. From the 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e 2025 baseline, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, led by Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), Industry (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Transport (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). **Ampol-2p5DS** also places the largest burden on Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), but adds a major contribution from Land Use (\u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) alongside Industry (\u201197.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Under **Ampol-House-View**, decarbonisation is materially weaker, with a total reduction of 195.63 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e; again power is the largest contributor (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), but industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and transport (\u201121.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) play smaller roles and Land Use emissions increase by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e rather than decline.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by sector from the 2025 baseline to 2050 under each scenario, highlighting the relative contribution of power, industry, transport, land use and other sectors.*\n\n### Power sector emissions\n\nElectricity generation decarbonises rapidly in all pathways. Starting from 129.87 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025, emissions fall by 99.3% in **Ampol-1p5DS**, reaching 0.94 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, and by a similar 99.3% in **Ampol-2p5DS** (0.95 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050). **Ampol-House-View** also shows deep power sector abatement, though slightly slower, with a 98.4% reduction to 2.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050\u2014around 1.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol-1p5DS. This rapid decline underpins the electrification trends discussed in the energy supply and demand sections.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from grid electricity generation by plant type from 2025 to 2050, showing steep declines across all scenarios as fossil-based generation is displaced.*\n\n### Transport emissions\n\nDomestic transport remains a key differentiator between scenarios. From a 2025 level of 98.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, **Ampol-1p5DS** cuts transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, consistent with rapid vehicle efficiency improvements, fuel switching and electrification across passenger and freight modes. **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves a more moderate 55.7% reduction, to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. Under **Ampol-House-View**, slower uptake of low\u2011emissions vehicles and fuels results in only a 21.4% reduction, leaving 77.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e of transport emissions in 2050\u201473.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol-1p5DS.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by mode from 2025 to 2050, illustrating the scale and timing of reductions in road, aviation, shipping and rail across scenarios.*\n\n### Built environment emissions\n\nEmissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) also diverge. From 14.25 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** eliminates building\u2011related emissions entirely by 2050 (\u2011100.0%), reflecting deep efficiency gains and near\u2011complete decarbonisation of heating and onsite energy use. **Ampol-2p5DS** halves these emissions to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201149.3%), while **Ampol-House-View** delivers a smaller 34.6% reduction to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. In 2050, built environment emissions are 9.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher under Ampol-House-View than under Ampol-1p5DS, underscoring the importance of accelerated building retrofit and electrification measures.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions to 2050, showing complete decarbonisation in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway versus more gradual reductions in the other scenarios.*"
