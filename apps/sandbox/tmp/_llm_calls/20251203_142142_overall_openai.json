  "response": "Across all scenarios, total electricity consumption rises substantially to 2050, reflecting widespread electrification of end-use sectors. From a common 2025 baseline of 355.36 TWh, electricity demand more than triples in **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)** to 1,019.51 TWh in 2050 (+186.9%), compared with 780.55 TWh in **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** (+119.7%) and 719.75 TWh in **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** (+102.5%). The 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway therefore requires around 300 TWh more electricity by 2050 than the reference case, highlighting the scale of additional clean power and network capacity needed to support deeper decarbonisation.\n\n![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector for all scenarios, showing stronger electrification and higher total demand under the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned) pathway.*\n\nDespite this growth in electricity use, total net emissions decline sharply in the transition scenarios. From 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, net emissions fall to -71.48 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 under Ampol-1p5DS (a 117.8% reduction, reaching net negative), and to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e under Ampol-2p5DS (a 99.1% reduction). In contrast, Ampol-House-View achieves only a 48.8% reduction, with net emissions of 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050\u2014around 276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway. This underscores that higher electricity demand, when met with low\u2011emissions supply, is compatible with\u2014and required for\u2014deep decarbonisation.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050, illustrating rapid declines and net-negative outcomes under the Ampol-1p5DS pathway compared with higher residual emissions in Ampol-House-View.*\n\nThe sectoral emissions reductions driving these outcomes are dominated by power generation, which delivers the largest cut in all scenarios (~129 Mt CO\u2082-e). Under Ampol-1p5DS, total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e are achieved, led by power generation (-128.92 Mt), industry (-109.74 Mt) and transport (-94.07 Mt). Ampol-2p5DS achieves 397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions, with a particularly large contribution from land use (-101.06 Mt). The reference pathway delivers only 195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions, and land use in this case becomes a net source (+33.58 Mt), reinforcing the importance of coordinated action across the energy and land sectors to align energy consumption growth with credible net-zero trajectories.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by sector relative to 2025, highlighting the central role of decarbonised power generation and electrification in the transition pathways.*"
