  "response": "Domestic transport remains one of the largest energy\u2011using sectors over the outlook period, but its trajectory diverges markedly by scenario. Across all modes and fuels, total domestic transport energy use is projected to fall from 1,447 PJ in 2025. In the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway) it declines by 42.0% to 840 PJ by 2050, driven by rapid electrification and efficiency gains. In the Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway) the decline is more moderate at 25.3%, reaching 1,081 PJ by 2050. Under the Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario), total demand is broadly flat, edging up by 0.2% to around 1,450 PJ in 2050. By mid\u2011century, domestic transport energy use in the reference scenario is therefore about 610 PJ higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway, highlighting the scale of demand reduction required for deep decarbonisation.\n\nOil-derived fuels (diesel, petrol and jet fuel) continue to dominate in the near term but decline sharply in the transition scenarios. In Ampol-1p5DS, use of conventional oil products falls to a small share of the mix by 2050, largely displaced by electricity, biofuels and hydrogen. Ampol-2p5DS shows a slower but still significant shift away from oil, with a more prominent role for blended and bio\u2011derived liquid fuels to complement electrification. In contrast, the Ampol-House-View retains a high dependence on oil products through 2050, with only gradual penetration of electricity and alternative fuels.\n\n![Domestic Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/domestic_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected domestic transport final energy use by fuel, 2025\u20132050, across scenarios.*\n\nRoad transport, which constitutes the majority of domestic transport energy demand, exhibits even stronger scenario differentiation. Starting from 1,177 PJ in 2025, road transport energy use in Ampol-1p5DS halves by 2050 to 557 PJ (\u201152.7%). Ampol-2p5DS records a 42.6% reduction to 675 PJ. Under Ampol-House-View, however, road transport demand falls by only 9.3%, to 1,068 PJ in 2050. The gap between the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned and reference pathways reaches 510 PJ by 2050, underscoring the importance of both modal efficiency improvements and drivetrain switching. The composition of road fuels shifts from diesel and petrol towards electricity and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen and advanced biofuels, particularly in the transition scenarios.\n\n![Road Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/road_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Road transport final energy use by fuel, highlighting the shift from oil products to electricity and low\u2011carbon fuels under the transition scenarios.*\n\nThe evolution of drivetrain technology underpins these energy trends. Although total new vehicle sales are normalised to 100% in each year, the mix of drivetrains changes substantially. In Ampol-1p5DS, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles rapidly lose market share, with long\u2011range battery electric vehicles and other electric configurations dominating new sales well before 2050. Ampol-2p5DS delivers a slower transition, with ICE and hybrid vehicles retaining a material share of new sales to mid\u2011century. Under Ampol-House-View, conventional combustion and hybrid vehicles continue to account for the majority of new vehicle sales, and electrification progresses more gradually.\n\n![New Vehicle Sales by Drivetrain](figures/new_vehicle_sales_by_drivetrain.png)  \n*Figure: Share of new light road vehicle sales by drivetrain type under each scenario.*\n\nThese dynamics are reflected in the on\u2011road vehicle stock. In Ampol-1p5DS, the proportion of ICE vehicles in the fleet declines steadily as earlier sales cohorts retire, with electric drivetrains becoming dominant in the overall stock by 2050. Ampol-2p5DS sees a slower rotation of the fleet, with a sizeable residual ICE presence at mid\u2011century. The Ampol-House-View maintains the highest share of combustion vehicles in 2050, implying slower efficiency gains and sustained demand for liquid fuels. The stock turnover profile is critical for understanding how quickly road transport energy demand and associated emissions can fall relative to changes in new sales.\n\n![Road Vehicle Stock by drivetrain](figures/road_vehicle_stock_by_drivetrain.png)  \n*Figure: Composition of the in\u2011use road vehicle fleet by drivetrain type, illustrating the lag between new sales trends and fleet transformation.*\n\nThe combined effect of changing activity, energy intensity and fuel mix is a pronounced divergence in domestic transport emissions outcomes (see also the economy\u2011wide emissions discussion). In the Ampol-1p5DS scenario, domestic transport emissions fall from 98.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to just 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, a 95.9% reduction. Ampol-2p5DS achieves a smaller yet substantial decline of 55.7%, to 43.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. Under Ampol-House-View, emissions decrease only 21.4%, remaining at 77.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050. The gap between the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned and reference scenarios reaches 73.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, with passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles providing much of the abatement potential through electrification and fuel switching, while heavy road transport and aviation decarbonise more gradually.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport greenhouse gas emissions by subsector, showing deep reductions under the transition scenarios compared with the reference pathway.*"
