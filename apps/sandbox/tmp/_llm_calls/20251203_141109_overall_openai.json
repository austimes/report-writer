  "response": "Electrification is a central feature of all scenarios, with total electricity consumption rising from 355.36 TWh in 2025 to between 719.75 TWh and 1,019.51 TWh by 2050. The strongest growth occurs in **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, where demand increases by 186.9%, nearly tripling by 2050 as transport, industry and new hydrogen production electrify. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** also more than doubles electricity use (+119.7% to 780.55 TWh), while the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** shows a smaller but still substantial increase of 102.5% to 719.75 TWh. By 2050, electricity consumption in Ampol-1p5DS is 299.8 TWh higher than in Ampol-House-View, underscoring the additional electrification required under a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned transition.\n\n![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector under the three scenarios, highlighting stronger growth in the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned) pathway.*\n\nFrom an emissions perspective, all scenarios deliver substantial reductions from the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, but with markedly different end states. Ampol-1p5DS reduces net emissions by 117.8% to **\u201371.48 Mt CO\u2082-e** in 2050, achieving net-negative outcomes. Ampol-2p5DS reduces emissions by 99.1% to **3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e**, effectively reaching net zero. In contrast, Ampol-House-View cuts emissions by only 48.8%, leaving **205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e** in 2050\u2014**276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e** higher than Ampol-1p5DS\u2014indicating that a reference trajectory falls well short of the reductions implied by temperature-aligned pathways.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Net emissions trajectories by sector, showing the progression from the 2025 baseline towards net zero and net-negative outcomes.*\n\nThe distribution of abatement across sectors is also highly differentiated. Starting from the same 2025 baseline (401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e), Ampol-1p5DS achieves the deepest total cuts (**\u2013472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e**), driven by major reductions in **Power Generation (\u2013128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e)**, **Industry (\u2013109.74 Mt CO\u2082-e)** and **Transport (\u201394.07 Mt CO\u2082-e)**. Ampol-2p5DS realises a comparable power-sector contribution (\u2013128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e) but relies more heavily on **Land Use (\u2013101.06 Mt CO\u2082-e)**, with a total reduction of **\u2013397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e**. In Ampol-House-View, overall abatement is much lower (**\u2013195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e**) and partially offset by a **33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e increase from Land Use**, highlighting the importance of coordinated decarbonisation across energy, industry, transport and land systems to support the higher electrification levels in the temperature-aligned scenarios.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by sector relative to 2025, illustrating the relative contribution of each sector to total abatement under the three scenarios.*"
