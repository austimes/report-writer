  "response": "Total national emissions across all sectors are projected to decline from 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025 under all scenarios, but the scale of reduction diverges markedly by 2050. In the **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall by 117.8% to \u201371.48 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, implying a net\u2011negative system supported by substantial land-use sequestration and carbon dioxide removal. The **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** almost fully decarbonises, reaching 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 (a 99.1% reduction). By contrast, the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** reduces emissions by only 48.8%, leaving 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050. By that date, total emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by major sector from 2025 to 2050 under the three scenarios, showing the pace and depth of decarbonisation.*\n\nFrom a sectoral perspective, all pathways start from the same 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, but the composition of reductions differs. **Power Generation** delivers the single largest abatement contribution in every case, at around 129 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions relative to 2025. In the Ampol-1p5DS, this is complemented by major cuts from **Industry** (\u2013109.74 Mt CO\u2082-e) and **Transport** (\u201394.07 Mt CO\u2082-e), with additional contributions from land use and engineered removals to reach a total reduction of \u2013472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050. The Ampol-2p5DS also relies on power decarbonisation but leans more heavily on **Land Use** (\u2013101.06 Mt CO\u2082-e) and slightly less on industry and transport (\u201397.01 and \u201355 Mt CO\u2082-e respectively), for a total reduction of \u2013397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e. In the Ampol-House-View, reductions are smaller and more concentrated in power (\u2013127.83 Mt CO\u2082-e) and industry (\u201372.37 Mt CO\u2082-e), while **Land Use becomes a net source**, increasing emissions by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e and materially limiting overall progress (net reduction \u2013195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e).\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative change in emissions from 2025 to 2050 by sector, highlighting the relative contribution of power, industry, transport, buildings, hydrogen and land use in each scenario.*\n\nDecarbonisation of **electricity generation** is rapid in all scenarios, underpinning emissions reductions in end\u2011use sectors discussed elsewhere in this report. Emissions from electricity fall from 129.87 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025 to 0.94 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 in the Ampol-1p5DS and 0.95 Mt CO\u2082-e in the Ampol-2p5DS, a 99.3% decline in both cases. Even in the Ampol-House-View, electricity emissions decline by 98.4% to 2.04 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050. Residual power\u2011sector emissions are therefore very small compared with other sources and are mainly relevant for achieving net\u2011negative outcomes in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from electricity generation by technology type from 2025 to 2050, showing near\u2011complete decarbonisation of the power sector in all scenarios.*\n\nIn **domestic transport**, however, the divergence between pathways is substantial. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, emissions in the Ampol-1p5DS decrease by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, reflecting deep electrification and efficiency improvements across passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, heavy freight and aviation. Under the Ampol-2p5DS, transport emissions fall by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082-e, leaving a sizeable residual. The Ampol-House-View shows only a 21.4% reduction, with 77.06 Mt CO\u2082-e remaining in 2050. By that year, domestic transport emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 73.1 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, making transport the single largest contributor to the gap between scenarios.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector (e.g. passenger vehicles, freight, aviation) illustrating the contrasting depth of decarbonisation across scenarios.*\n\nEmissions from the **built environment (residential and commercial buildings)** also show strongly scenario\u2011dependent outcomes. In 2025, building emissions total 14.25 Mt CO\u2082-e. In the Ampol-1p5DS, these are fully eliminated by 2050 (\u2013100.0%), consistent with near\u2011total electrification and high building efficiency. The Ampol-2p5DS achieves a 49.3% reduction to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082-e, while the Ampol-House-View delivers only a 34.6% reduction, with 9.32 Mt CO\u2082-e remaining in 2050. Consequently, 2050 building emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 9.3 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, adding to the residual emissions gap.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions projections, highlighting complete abatement in the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway versus partial reductions in the other scenarios.*\n\nOverall, the projections indicate that while power-sector decarbonisation proceeds rapidly in all scenarios, achieving deep economy\u2011wide emissions reductions consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome depends critically on accelerated abatement in transport, buildings, industry, and land use, supported by both natural sequestration and engineered carbon dioxide removal."
