  "response": "## Emissions\n\nProjected emissions trajectories diverge markedly across the three scenarios, both in terms of overall abatement and the relative contribution of key sectors.\n\nTotal national emissions in 2025 are estimated at 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. Under the Ampol\u20111p5DS scenario, net emissions fall to \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction relative to 2025, implying a transition to net\u2011negative emissions. Ampol\u20112p5DS delivers a 99.1% reduction to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, approaching net\u2011zero but not reaching net\u2011negative levels. Under Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, emissions decline more modestly, by 48.8% to 205.41 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, leaving a gap of 276.9 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to Ampol\u20111p5DS.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 under each scenario, showing the pace and depth of decarbonisation and the emergence of net\u2011negative outcomes in Ampol\u20111p5DS.*\n\nAcross all scenarios, power generation is the largest single source of abatement. From a 2025 baseline of 129.87 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, electricity\u2011related emissions decline by 99.3% in both Ampol\u20111p5DS and Ampol\u20112p5DS, reaching 0.94 and 0.95 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e respectively by 2050. Even in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, electricity emissions fall by 98.4% to 2.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050. This deep decarbonisation of electricity underpins emissions reductions in end\u2011use sectors through electrification.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from grid electricity generation by technology, highlighting rapid phase\u2011down of fossil\u2011fuel plant across all scenarios.*\n\nWhen decomposed by sector, Ampol\u20111p5DS delivers the deepest overall cuts, with cumulative reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to 2025. Power generation contributes the largest single reduction (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), followed by industry (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and transport (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Ampol\u20112p5DS also relies heavily on these sectors, with reductions of \u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e from power, \u201197.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e from industry and \u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e from land use. Under Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, total reductions are less than half those in Ampol\u20111p5DS (\u2011195.63 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), and while power (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) still decarbonise substantially, transport abatement is more limited (\u201121.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and land\u2011use emissions increase by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, partially offsetting gains elsewhere.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions from 2025 by major sector, highlighting the dominance of power, industry, transport and land\u2011use outcomes in determining total abatement.*\n\nTransport and the built environment show the strongest divergence between scenarios. Domestic transport emissions, which start at 98.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025, fall by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol\u20111p5DS, consistent with rapid electrification and efficiency improvements across road, aviation and shipping subsectors. In Ampol\u20112p5DS, transport emissions decline by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, while under Ampol\u2011House\u2011View they fall by only 21.4% to 77.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. By 2050, transport emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View are 73.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS, representing a major share of the overall gap between scenarios.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector, illustrating the differing rates of decarbonisation and residual emissions across scenarios.*\n\nEmissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) also vary substantially. From a 2025 level of 14.25 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, Ampol\u20111p5DS achieves full decarbonisation by 2050, with emissions reaching zero (a 100% reduction). Ampol\u20112p5DS halves building emissions to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201149.3%), while Ampol\u2011House\u2011View achieves a smaller reduction to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201134.6%). Consequently, built environment emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View remain 9.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS in 2050.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions to 2050, showing complete decarbonisation only in the Ampol\u20111p5DS scenario.*\n\nCollectively, these projections indicate that achieving a net\u2011negative outcome consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway requires near\u2011complete decarbonisation of power, transport and buildings, substantial industrial abatement, and net land\u2011use sequestration. Under the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, slower progress in transport and buildings, combined with rising land\u2011use emissions, leaves a large residual emissions footprint by mid\u2011century."
