  "response": "Industrial final energy demand declines materially across all scenarios, while emissions fall more rapidly as fuel switching and process changes take effect. Total industry energy use is projected to fall from 1,555 PJ in 2025 to between 1,089 PJ (Ampol-2p5DS, 2.5\u00b0C pathway) and 1,179 PJ (Ampol-1p5DS, 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway) by 2050, a reduction of 24\u201330%. The reference/baseline scenario Ampol-House-View is similar, reaching 1,164 PJ by 2050 (\u201125.2%). Despite comparable aggregate reductions, the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway maintains around 90 PJ more industrial energy use than the 2.5\u00b0C pathway in 2050, reflecting higher residual activity and deeper electrification.\n\n![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected final energy use in industry by fuel under the three scenarios, showing declining overall demand and a shift away from fossil fuels.*\n\nThe fuel mix shifts markedly over the projection period. Across all scenarios, the reliance on natural gas and coal in industry declines, displaced by electricity, biomass, emerging low\u2011emission fuels and direct electrification technologies. This is most pronounced in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway, where stronger decarbonisation of heat and processes leads to faster reductions in fossil fuel use but maintains overall energy requirements due to efficiency penalties associated with some low\u2011emissions technologies. These fuel\u2011mix changes are consistent with the broader electrification trends highlighted in other sectors of this report.\n\nThe iron and steel subsector illustrates the divergence between pathways. Starting from 98.7 PJ in 2025, iron and steel energy use grows to 166.1 PJ by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS, a 68.3% increase, driven by a transition toward electricity, natural gas and hydrogen-based production routes. By contrast, energy use falls sharply to 28.5 PJ in Ampol-2p5DS (\u201171.1%) and to 68.9 PJ in Ampol-House-View (\u201130.2%), indicating lower production volumes and slower adoption of new technologies relative to the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway.\n\n![Iron and Steel Energy Use by Fuel](figures/iron_and_steel_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Iron and steel sector energy use by fuel, highlighting growth and strong fuel switching in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway versus contraction in other scenarios.*\n\nWhile energy use falls moderately, industrial greenhouse gas emissions decline much more steeply, underscoring the importance of decarbonising fuels and processes. Aggregate industry emissions fall from 146.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (\u201174.8%), and to 49.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (\u201166.1%). Under Ampol-House-View, emissions decline less, to 74.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201149.3%), leaving 2050 emissions 37.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway. The sharper reductions in Ampol-1p5DS reflect faster phase\u2011out of fossil fuels, process changes in emissions\u2011intensive subsectors and earlier deployment of low\u2011emissions technologies, with only limited contributions from captured emissions.\n\n![Industry Emissions and Captured Emissions](figures/industry_emissions_and_captured_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Total industry emissions, split between process and combustion sources, with captured emissions and net emissions for each scenario.*\n\nWithin manufacturing, emissions reductions are substantial in the decarbonisation pathways but more muted in the reference case. Total manufacturing emissions fall from 61.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (\u201159.7%) and to 31.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (\u201148.7%). In contrast, the Ampol-House-View scenario records only a modest decline to 51.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201116.4%), remaining 26.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e above the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned outcome in 2050. The largest absolute reductions occur in iron and steel, alumina and cement, where a combination of fuel switching, efficiency and process innovation materially lowers emissions. Other subsectors, such as food and beverages and paper products, see smaller but still meaningful declines, primarily through improved efficiency and increased electrification.\n\n![Manufacturing Emissions by Sector](figures/manufacturing_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Manufacturing emissions by subsector, demonstrating deeper decarbonisation in emissions\u2011intensive industries under the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway.*\n\nCarbon capture in the chemical sector plays a limited but distinct role. In Ampol-2p5DS, captured emissions from chemical processes reach around 1.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 (net emissions of \u20111.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), with capture applied to coal and natural\u2011gas\u2011based production routes and urea production. This contrasts with the Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-House-View scenarios, where chemical sector captured emissions remain close to zero by 2050. As a result, 2050 chemical captured emissions in Ampol-House-View are around 1.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher (i.e. less negative) than in Ampol-2p5DS.\n\n![Chemical Captured Emissions by Process](figures/chemical_captured_emissions_by_process.png)  \n*Figure: Captured emissions from key chemical processes, showing the deployment of carbon capture in the 2.5\u00b0C pathway relative to minimal uptake in other scenarios.*\n\nOverall, the industrial sector\u2019s projections indicate that deep emissions reductions are achievable with only moderate declines in total energy use, provided there is sustained investment in electrification, fuel switching and process innovation\u2014particularly in hard\u2011to\u2011abate subsectors such as iron and steel, alumina and cement."
