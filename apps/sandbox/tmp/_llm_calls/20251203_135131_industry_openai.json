  "response": "### Industry\n\nProjected industrial energy demand declines across all scenarios, while emissions fall more rapidly, reflecting fuel switching, efficiency improvements and targeted deployment of carbon capture.\n\nTotal final energy use in industry falls from 1,555 PJ in 2025 to between 1,089 PJ (Ampol\u20112p5DS) and 1,179 PJ (Ampol\u20111p5DS) by 2050, a reduction of 30.0% and 24.2% respectively. The Ampol\u2011House\u2011View shows a similar 25.2% decline to 1,164 PJ in 2050. Despite these aggregate reductions, the fuel mix shifts materially: fossil fuels, particularly natural gas and coal, contract while electricity, electrification technologies, hydrogen and biomethane expand their shares, especially in the higher\u2011ambition 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\n![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure 1: Projected industrial final energy use by fuel, 2025\u20132050, under the three scenarios.*\n\nThese changes in energy use translate into substantial emissions reductions. Total industrial emissions decline from 146.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 in Ampol\u20111p5DS (\u201174.8%), and to 49.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201166.1%) in Ampol\u20112p5DS. Under the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, emissions fall more modestly to 74.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201149.3%), leaving a 37.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e gap to the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned outcome in 2050. Reductions arise from both combustion and process emissions, with captured emissions playing a limited but growing role in the tighter decarbonisation pathways.\n\n![Industry Emissions and Captured Emissions](figures/industry_emissions_and_captured_emissions.png)  \n*Figure 2: Total industrial process and combustion emissions, including captured emissions, 2025\u20132050.*\n\nWithin heavy industry, iron and steel shows divergent trajectories across scenarios. In Ampol\u20111p5DS, total energy use in this subsector increases from 98.7 PJ in 2025 to 166.1 PJ in 2050 (+68.3%), driven by a transition away from coal toward electricity, natural gas and emerging hydrogen\u2011based processes. By contrast, in Ampol\u20112p5DS energy use falls sharply to 28.5 PJ (\u201171.1%), while the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View records a more moderate decline to 68.9 PJ (\u201130.2%). By 2050, energy use in iron and steel is 137.6 PJ higher in Ampol\u20111p5DS than in Ampol\u20112p5DS, highlighting the interaction between activity growth and deep decarbonisation technologies in this sector.\n\n![Iron and Steel Energy Use by Fuel](figures/iron_and_steel_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure 3: Iron and steel energy consumption by fuel type, 2025\u20132050.*\n\nManufacturing emissions as a whole fall from 61.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 in Ampol\u20111p5DS (\u201159.7%) and to 31.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201148.7%) in Ampol\u20112p5DS. Under the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, emissions only fall to 51.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201116.4%), remaining 26.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than the 1.5\u00b0C pathway in 2050. Reductions are distributed across iron and steel, alumina, cement, aluminium and other manufacturing subsectors, reflecting fuel substitution, electrification and efficiency gains.\n\n![Manufacturing Emissions by Sector](figures/manufacturing_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure 4: Manufacturing emissions by subsector, 2025\u20132050, under each scenario.*\n\nCarbon capture in the chemicals subsector is limited and scenario\u2011dependent. In Ampol\u20112p5DS, captured emissions from chemical processes reach around 1.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, while remaining negligible in both the Ampol\u20111p5DS and Ampol\u2011House\u2011View scenarios. This indicates that, in the modelled pathways, deep decarbonisation of chemicals relies more heavily on process change and fuel switching than on large\u2011scale deployment of carbon capture and storage.\n\n![Chemical Captured Emissions by Process](figures/chemical_captured_emissions_by_process.png)  \n*Figure 5: Captured emissions from key chemical processes, 2025\u20132050.*"
