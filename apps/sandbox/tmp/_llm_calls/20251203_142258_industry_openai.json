  "response": "Industry energy demand declines across all scenarios, but at a slower rate than industrial emissions, reflecting both structural change in output and progressive decarbonisation of the fuel mix. Total final energy use falls from 1,555 PJ in 2025 to between 1,089 PJ and 1,179 PJ by 2050. The deepest reduction occurs under Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway), where demand contracts by 30.0% to 1,089 PJ. Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway) records a slightly smaller reduction of 24.2% to 1,179 PJ, and the Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario) shows a 25.2% decline to 1,164 PJ. By 2050, industrial energy use in Ampol-1p5DS is 90 PJ higher than in Ampol-2p5DS, indicating that more ambitious decarbonisation in this pathway is achieved primarily through fuel switching and process change rather than deeper energy demand destruction.\n\n![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected final energy use in industry by fuel, showing declining total demand and a transition away from natural gas, coal and diesel towards electricity, electrification, biomass, hydrogen and biomethane across all scenarios.*\n\nThe fuel mix shifts markedly over the projection period. Fossil fuels such as natural gas, black coal and diesel decline as shares of total energy, replaced by higher shares of electricity and dedicated electrification, supported by emerging low\u2011carbon fuels including hydrogen, biomass and biomethane by mid\u2011century. This transition is most pronounced in the decarbonisation pathways, where electrification and low\u2011emissions fuels supply a growing share of residual industrial energy demand, consistent with trends discussed in the electricity and fuels sections of this report.\n\nWithin industry, iron and steel exhibits the greatest divergence across scenarios. Starting from 98.7 PJ in 2025, energy use in this subsector rises by 68.3% in Ampol-1p5DS to 166.1 PJ in 2050, driven by a transition away from coal towards electricity, natural gas and hydrogen, which increases total energy requirements but substantially lowers emissions intensity. In contrast, iron and steel energy demand falls by 71.1% in Ampol-2p5DS to 28.5 PJ, and by 30.2% in the Ampol-House-View to 68.9 PJ, reflecting lower output and more limited fuel switching. By 2050, the subsector\u2019s energy use in Ampol-1p5DS is 137.6 PJ higher than in Ampol-2p5DS, underpinning the higher overall industrial energy demand seen in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway.\n\n![Iron and Steel Energy Use by Fuel](figures/iron_and_steel_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Iron and steel energy use by fuel, highlighting strong growth and coal-to-electricity/gas/hydrogen switching in Ampol-1p5DS versus contraction and continued reliance on existing technologies in Ampol-2p5DS and the Ampol-House-View.*\n\nDespite comparatively modest reductions in energy demand, industrial emissions decline sharply due to fuel substitution, process changes and targeted deployment of carbon capture. Total industry emissions fall from 146.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (a 74.8% reduction), and to 49.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (66.1% reduction). Under the Ampol-House-View, emissions decline more slowly, to 74.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (49.3% reduction). The gap between the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway and the baseline reaches 37.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, underscoring the importance of deep decarbonisation measures beyond efficiency alone.\n\n![Industry Emissions and Captured Emissions](figures/industry_emissions_and_captured_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Total industry emissions by type, showing strong reductions in combustion and process emissions, with captured emissions contributing modestly to net abatement, particularly in the decarbonisation pathways.*\n\nManufacturing subsectors follow a similar pattern. Aggregate manufacturing emissions decrease from 61.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (\u201359.7%), to 31.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (\u201348.7%), and to 51.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in the Ampol-House-View (\u201316.4%). The steepest reductions occur in energy\u2011 and emissions\u2011intensive segments such as iron and steel, alumina, cement and petroleum refining, reflecting the combined effects of electrification, alternative feedstocks and process optimisation.\n\n![Manufacturing Emissions by Sector](figures/manufacturing_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Manufacturing emissions by sector, illustrating substantial decarbonisation in heavy industries under Ampol-1p5DS and more moderate reductions in Ampol-2p5DS and the Ampol-House-View.*\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a targeted but currently limited role in industrial decarbonisation. In chemicals, CCS deployment appears only in Ampol-2p5DS, where captured emissions reach 1.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, while remaining negligible in both Ampol-1p5DS and the Ampol-House-View. This suggests that, within the modelling horizon, most industrial abatement arises from energy efficiency, electrification and fuel switching, with CCS concentrated in specific chemical processes.\n\n![Chemical Captured Emissions by Process](figures/chemical_captured_emissions_by_process.png)  \n*Figure: Captured emissions in chemical production, showing modest CCS deployment in the Ampol-2p5DS scenario and no material capture in Ampol-1p5DS or the Ampol-House-View.*"
