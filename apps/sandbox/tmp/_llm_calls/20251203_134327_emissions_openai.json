  "response": "## Emissions\n\nProjected national emissions fall substantially from the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in all scenarios, but the scale and distribution of reductions vary materially.\n\nUnder the Ampol\u20111p5DS, total net emissions decline by 117.8% between 2025 and 2050, reaching \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, implying a net\u2011negative system. The Ampol\u20112p5DS achieves a 99.1% reduction over the period, stabilising just above net zero at 3.52 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050. In contrast, the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View delivers a 48.8% reduction, with residual emissions of 205.41 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050\u2014around 277 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway. These trajectories highlight the importance of both the pace and breadth of decarbonisation across sectors.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 across scenarios, showing the transition from positive to net\u2011negative emissions in Ampol\u20111p5DS, near\u2011zero outcomes in Ampol\u20112p5DS, and substantial residual emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View.*\n\n### Sectoral contributions to emissions reductions\n\nAll scenarios start from the same 2025 baseline but differ in how reductions are distributed:\n\n- **Ampol\u20111p5DS** achieves the deepest aggregate cut, with total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to 2025. Power Generation provides the largest single contribution (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), followed by Industry (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Transport (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Land Use, Buildings and carbon dioxide removal together deliver the remaining reductions needed to reach net\u2011negative emissions.\n- **Ampol\u20112p5DS** delivers a 397.51 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e reduction, driven by Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), Land Use (\u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Industry (\u201197.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Transport decarbonisation is more gradual than in the 1.5\u00b0C pathway, leaving higher residual emissions.\n- **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** records a more modest total reduction of 195.63 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. Power Generation still decarbonises strongly (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), but Industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Transport (\u201121.01 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) progress more slowly. Land Use is a net source rather than a sink, with emissions increasing by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, materially weakening overall performance.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by major sector from the 2025 baseline to 2050, highlighting the dominant role of Power Generation and the differing contributions from Transport, Industry and Land Use in each scenario.*\n\n### Power generation\n\nDecarbonisation of electricity is rapid and deep in all scenarios. Emissions from electricity generation fall from 129.87 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 0.94 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 under Ampol\u20111p5DS and 0.95 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e under Ampol\u20112p5DS, a 99.3% reduction in both cases. Even in the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, where fossil generation is retired more slowly, emissions decline by 98.4% to 2.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050. The small divergence between scenarios underscores that power sector decarbonisation is a robust feature of the transition, largely independent of broader assumptions.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from electricity generation by technology, showing near\u2011complete phase\u2011out of emissions from steam turbines and gas\u2011fired plant in all scenarios by 2050.*\n\n### Domestic transport\n\nTransport emissions show the greatest divergence across scenarios. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025:\n\n- Under **Ampol\u20111p5DS**, domestic transport emissions fall by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, reflecting rapid electrification of road transport and efficiency improvements across all subsectors.\n- Under **Ampol\u20112p5DS**, emissions decline by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, with slower uptake of zero\u2011emissions vehicles and continued reliance on liquid fuels in heavy and long\u2011distance segments.\n- In the **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View**, transport emissions fall only 21.4% to 77.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, leaving the sector 73.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. Passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles and heavy trucks remain the dominant sources of residual emissions.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector, illustrating rapid, broad\u2011based reductions in the 1.5\u00b0C pathway compared with slower and more uneven decarbonisation in the other scenarios.*\n\n### Built environment\n\nEmissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) also vary significantly:\n\n- In **Ampol\u20111p5DS**, building emissions fall from 14.25 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to zero by 2050, a 100% reduction. This is consistent with full electrification of space and water heating, high building efficiency standards and low\u2011emissions electricity.\n- **Ampol\u20112p5DS** achieves a 49.3% reduction, with emissions declining to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050.\n- **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** is less ambitious, with emissions falling 34.6% to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050\u20149.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions to 2050, showing full decarbonisation in Ampol\u20111p5DS and persistent residual emissions in the other scenarios.*\n\n### Implications\n\nAcross the projection period, achieving outcomes consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway requires not only near\u2011complete decarbonisation of power generation, but also deep reductions in transport, industry, buildings and net Land Use emissions. While the House\u2011View scenario assumes strong progress in the power sector, slower structural change in other sectors and net Land Use emissions becoming a source rather than a sink result in substantially higher residual national emissions by 2050."
