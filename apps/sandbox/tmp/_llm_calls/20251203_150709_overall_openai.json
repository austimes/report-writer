  "response": "Across all scenarios, overall energy use is characterised by strong electrification alongside deep, but variable, emissions reductions. Total electricity consumption more than doubles from 355.36 TWh in 2025 in every case, reaching 1,019.51 TWh by 2050 in **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway), 780.55 TWh in **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5\u00b0C pathway), and 719.75 TWh in **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario). This represents growth of 186.9%, 119.7% and 102.5% respectively, with the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway requiring around 300 TWh more electricity than the reference case by 2050, reflecting greater fuel switching and electrification across transport, industry and buildings.\n\n![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector under the three scenarios, 2025\u20132050 (TWh).*\n\nDespite this strong growth in electricity demand, total net emissions fall sharply from 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025 in all decarbonisation scenarios. **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers the most ambitious outcome, reaching net negative emissions of -71.48 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction from 2025 levels. **Ampol-2p5DS** reduces emissions by 99.1% to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, effectively achieving net-zero. In contrast, **Ampol-House-View** achieves a 48.8% reduction, with residual emissions of 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050\u2014around 276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, underscoring the scale of additional abatement required beyond the reference trajectory.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Net emissions by sector under the three scenarios, 2025\u20132050 (Mt CO\u2082-e).*\n\nThe decomposition of abatement highlights that power generation, industry and transport drive the majority of emissions reductions. From a 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers total cuts of -472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050, led by power generation (-128.92 Mt), industry (-109.74 Mt) and transport (-94.07 Mt). **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves -397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions, again with power generation (~-129 Mt) as the largest single contributor, followed by land use (-101.06 Mt) and industry (-97.01 Mt). Under **Ampol-House-View**, total reductions are more modest at -195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e and are partially offset by a net increase in land-use emissions (+33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e), leaving greater reliance on ongoing fossil fuel use and slower structural change. Detailed sectoral drivers of these trends are discussed in the subsequent sub-sections.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by sector between 2025 and 2050 relative to the 2025 baseline (Mt CO\u2082-e).*"
