  "response": "Net national emissions across all sectors decline from 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025 in every scenario, but with markedly different end-states. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies a net\u2011negative system. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** almost fully abates emissions, reaching 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 (\u201199.1%), while the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** still emits 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 (\u201148.8%). By 2050, the gap between Ampol\u2011House\u2011View and Ampol\u20111p5DS is 276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e, highlighting the scale of additional abatement and removals required in a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned trajectory.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 under the three scenarios, including the transition to net\u2011zero and net\u2011negative outcomes.*\n\nThe distribution of reductions across sectors varies between pathways, but power generation is consistently the single largest source of abatement. From a 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, **Ampol\u20111p5DS** delivers total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050, led by Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e), Industry (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082-e) and Transport (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082-e). **Ampol\u20112p5DS** achieves 397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions, with Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e), Land Use (\u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082-e) and Industry (\u201197.01 Mt CO\u2082-e) providing most of the abatement. In the **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** scenario, total reductions are more modest at 195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e: Power Generation (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082-e) and Industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082-e) still decarbonise substantially, but Transport reductions are limited (\u201121.01 Mt CO\u2082-e) and Land Use emissions increase by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e, offsetting progress elsewhere.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions reductions by major sector in 2050 relative to 2025, showing the contribution of each sector to total abatement under the three scenarios.*\n\nElectricity generation decarbonises rapidly in all scenarios, reflecting strong structural change in the power system (discussed in the energy supply section). From 129.87 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, emissions fall by 99.3% under both **Ampol\u20111p5DS** and **Ampol\u20112p5DS**, reaching 0.94 and 0.95 Mt CO\u2082-e respectively in 2050. Even in **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View**, power sector emissions decline by 98.4% to 2.04 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, leaving only a small residual difference of 1.1 Mt CO\u2082-e compared with Ampol\u20111p5DS.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from electricity generation by technology from 2025 to 2050, illustrating the near\u2011complete phase\u2011out of fossil-based generation across all scenarios.*\n\nIn **domestic transport**, the divergence between scenarios is much more pronounced. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, **Ampol\u20111p5DS** cuts domestic transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, implying near\u2011full decarbonisation across road, rail, aviation and shipping subsectors. Under **Ampol\u20112p5DS**, emissions fall by only 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082-e, and in **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** by just 21.4% to 77.06 Mt CO\u2082-e. By 2050, domestic transport emissions in the reference pathway are 73.1 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS, underscoring the critical role of accelerated electrification, alternative fuels and efficiency improvements explored in the transport section.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector from 2025 to 2050, highlighting contrasting decarbonisation rates across scenarios.*\n\nThe **built environment** shows a similar pattern of divergence. In 2025, residential and commercial buildings together emit 14.25 Mt CO\u2082-e. Under **Ampol\u20111p5DS**, these emissions decline steadily to zero by 2050, achieving a 100% reduction and eliminating direct emissions from the built environment. **Ampol\u20112p5DS** delivers a 49.3% reduction, to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082-e, while **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** achieves a 34.6% reduction, to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082-e. As a result, 2050 emissions from buildings in the reference scenario are 9.3 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway, with both residential and commercial segments falling short of full decarbonisation.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions from 2025 to 2050, showing complete abatement in Ampol\u20111p5DS versus partial reductions in other scenarios.*\n\nTaken together, the projections indicate that achieving a 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned outcome relies on: (i) rapid, near\u2011complete decarbonisation of power, buildings and domestic transport; (ii) deep industrial abatement; and (iii) substantial net removals and land sector improvements. In contrast, the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View pathway locks in significantly higher residual emissions to 2050, particularly from transport, buildings and land use."
