  "response": "Industry final energy demand declines steadily across all scenarios, with stronger efficiency and electrification only partly offset by growth in industrial output. From a common 2025 baseline of 1,555 PJ, total industry energy use falls to 1,179 PJ in Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, \u221224.2%), 1,089 PJ in Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway, \u221230.0%), and 1,164 PJ in Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario, \u221225.2%) by 2050. Despite lower total demand in Ampol-2p5DS, Ampol-1p5DS remains more energy\u2011intensive in 2050, with total consumption 90 PJ higher, reflecting deeper process electrification and fuel switching to low\u2011carbon energy carriers rather than absolute demand reduction alone.\n\nAcross all scenarios, fossil fuel use in industry is progressively displaced by low\u2011emissions energy. Natural gas and black coal use decline materially, with coal largely eliminated in deep decarbonisation pathways by mid\u2011century. Electricity demand increases its share of the industrial energy mix in all scenarios, complemented by growing contributions from biomass, hydrogen, biomethane and dedicated \u201celectrification\u201d technologies. These trends underpin a significant decoupling of industrial activity from direct fossil fuel use.\n\n![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected total industry final energy use by fuel from 2025\u20132050 under the three scenarios, showing declining fossil fuel use and rising electricity and alternative low\u2011carbon fuels.*\n\nIndustrial emissions fall more rapidly than energy demand as fuel and process decarbonisation accelerate. Total industry emissions decline from 146.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (\u221274.8%), and to 49.8 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (\u221266.1%). Under Ampol-House-View, emissions reduce more modestly to 74.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u221249.3%), remaining 37.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol-1p5DS by 2050. The stronger reductions in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway reflect deeper decarbonisation of both combustion and process emissions, enabled by electrification, fuel switching and targeted deployment of capture technologies.\n\n![Industry Emissions and Captured Emissions](figures/industry_emissions_and_captured_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Total industry combustion and process emissions, captured emissions and resulting net emissions to 2050, illustrating faster decarbonisation in the Ampol\u20111p5DS and Ampol\u20112p5DS pathways compared with the reference scenario.*\n\nWithin manufacturing, emissions reductions are broad\u2011based but uneven across subsectors. Aggregate manufacturing emissions decline from 61.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (\u221259.7%) and to 31.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in Ampol-2p5DS (\u221248.7%), compared with only a modest reduction to 51.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u221216.4%) under Ampol-House-View. The largest absolute reductions occur in energy\u2011intensive segments such as iron and steel, alumina, cement and petroleum refining, where fuel switching, efficiency and process changes deliver substantial emissions cuts in the decarbonisation pathways, while emissions remain comparatively elevated in the reference case.\n\n![Manufacturing Emissions by Sector](figures/manufacturing_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Manufacturing emissions by subsector from 2025\u20132050 across the three scenarios, highlighting stronger reductions in emissions\u2011intensive industries under the decarbonisation pathways.*\n\nIron and steel illustrate how structural change and technology choices shape energy use outcomes. From an initial 98.7 PJ in 2025, iron and steel energy consumption rises sharply to 166.1 PJ by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (+68.3%), but falls to 28.5 PJ in Ampol-2p5DS (\u221271.1%) and to 68.9 PJ in Ampol-House-View (\u221230.2%). In the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway, coal is progressively displaced by electricity and low\u2011carbon gases (including hydrogen), consistent with a shift toward electric and direct\u2011reduced iron routes that are more electricity\u2011intensive but far less emissions\u2011intensive. In contrast, the 2.5\u00b0C pathway achieves deep coal phase\u2011out with limited expansion in low\u2011carbon iron and steel production capacity, resulting in much lower overall energy demand in this subsector.\n\n![Iron and Steel Energy Use by Fuel](figures/iron_and_steel_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Iron and steel sector energy use by fuel under each scenario, showing contrasting trajectories between coal\u2011based routes and more electricity\u2011 and gas\u2011intensive low\u2011carbon processes.*\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a targeted but relatively small role in the chemical subsector by 2050. Chemical captured emissions remain negligible in both Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-House-View (around 0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050), while Ampol-2p5DS reaches captured emissions of 1.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, predominantly from CCS applied to gas\u2011based or coal\u2011based processes. As a result, the reference scenario\u2019s chemical emissions are approximately 1.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in the 2.5\u00b0C pathway by mid\u2011century, underscoring that, even in more moderate decarbonisation pathways, CCS can deliver incremental emissions reductions where process emissions are otherwise difficult to abate.\n\n![Chemical Captured Emissions by Process](figures/chemical_captured_emissions_by_process.png)  \n*Figure: Captured emissions in chemical manufacturing processes to 2050, indicating limited but non\u2011negligible deployment of CCS in the Ampol\u20112p5DS scenario.*"
