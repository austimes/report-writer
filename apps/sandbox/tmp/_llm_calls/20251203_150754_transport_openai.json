  "response": "Domestic transport is a major driver of final energy demand, and the scenarios show a wide divergence in long\u2011term outcomes. In the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway), total domestic transport energy use declines from 1,447 PJ in 2025 to 840 PJ in 2050, a 42% reduction. Under Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway), demand falls more moderately to 1,081 PJ by 2050 (\u201325.3%), while in Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario) overall domestic transport energy remains effectively flat, ending at 1,450 PJ (+0.2%). By 2050, this leaves domestic transport in Ampol-House-View consuming around 610 PJ more energy than in Ampol-1p5DS.\n\n![Domestic Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/domestic_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)\n*Figure: Projected domestic transport final energy use by fuel under each scenario, highlighting faster displacement of oil products by electricity, hydrogen and biofuels in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway.*\n\nRoad transport, the largest subsector, accounts for most of this change. In Ampol-1p5DS, road transport energy demand halves over the projection period, falling from 1,177 PJ in 2025 to 557 PJ in 2050 (\u201352.7%). Ampol-2p5DS shows a smaller decline to 675 PJ (\u201342.6%), whereas Ampol-House-View only reduces road energy demand to 1,068 PJ by 2050 (\u20139.3%). As a result, road transport energy use in 2050 is about 510 PJ higher in Ampol-House-View than in Ampol-1p5DS. Across the decarbonisation scenarios, oil-based fuels (diesel and petrol) contract sharply and are progressively replaced by electricity, biofuels and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen.\n\n![Road Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/road_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)\n*Figure: Road transport energy consumption by fuel, showing deep reductions in oil demand and strong electrification under Ampol-1p5DS compared with a more gradual transition in Ampol-2p5DS and sustained liquid fuel demand in Ampol-House-View.*\n\nThe evolution of new vehicle sales underpins these energy trajectories. In Ampol-1p5DS, combustion engine vehicles rapidly lose market share, with battery electric drivetrains (including long-range and autonomous electric vehicles) dominating new sales by the late 2030s. Ampol-2p5DS exhibits a slower but still material shift, with combustion engines persisting in a non-trivial share of sales into the 2040s. In contrast, Ampol-House-View retains a high proportion of internal combustion engine sales through to 2050, with low penetration of zero-emissions drivetrains. These differences in technology uptake directly drive the pace of fuel switching and efficiency gains in road transport.\n\n![New Vehicle Sales by Drivetrain](figures/new_vehicle_sales_by_drivetrain.png)\n*Figure: Shares of new light and heavy road vehicle sales by drivetrain type, indicating the speed and depth of electrification and alternative drivetrains across scenarios.*\n\nChanges in fleet composition lag changes in new sales but follow a similar pattern. Under Ampol-1p5DS, the stock of combustion engine vehicles declines steadily as electrified and fuel cell vehicles diffuse through the fleet, reaching a predominantly zero-emissions road vehicle stock by 2050. Ampol-2p5DS still achieves a substantial shift away from combustion engines but retains a sizeable share of legacy vehicles at mid\u2011century. Under Ampol-House-View, combustion engine vehicles remain the dominant share of the road fleet in 2050, constraining reductions in both energy demand and emissions.\n\n![Road Vehicle Stock by drivetrain](figures/road_vehicle_stock_by_drivetrain.png)\n*Figure: Road vehicle stock by drivetrain type, illustrating fleet turnover dynamics and the slower decarbonisation of the in\u2011use fleet relative to new sales, particularly in the baseline scenario.*\n\nThe combined effect of reduced energy demand and fuel switching is reflected in domestic transport emissions. In Ampol-1p5DS, domestic transport emissions fall from 98.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025 to just 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, a 95.9% reduction, with all subsectors\u2014including passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, trucks and aviation\u2014converging towards very low emissions. Ampol-2p5DS achieves a 55.7% decline to 43.4 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050, while Ampol-House-View delivers only a 21.4% reduction to 77.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. The gap between Ampol-House-View and Ampol-1p5DS reaches 73.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, underlining the critical role of rapid transport decarbonisation in meeting economy-wide emissions objectives discussed in the emissions section of this report.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)\n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector, showing deep, broad-based reductions across all modes in Ampol-1p5DS, more gradual declines in Ampol-2p5DS, and comparatively limited abatement under Ampol-House-View.*"
