  "response": "Agricultural energy demand is projected to be broadly stable to moderately declining across scenarios, with divergent decarbonisation trajectories driven more by fuel switching and non\u2011energy abatement than by changes in total final energy use. In all cases, sectoral energy consumption starts at 107.69 PJ in 2025. Under **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway), total agricultural energy use falls to 88.75 PJ by 2050, a 17.6% reduction. The **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5\u00b0C pathway) and **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario) show more limited reductions to 99.56 PJ and 101.1 PJ respectively by 2050 (7.5% and 6.1% decreases). By 2050, agricultural energy use in the reference/baseline case is 12.3 PJ higher than in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway, underscoring the additional demand reduction and fuel switching required for deeper decarbonisation.\n\nAcross all scenarios, the fuel mix shifts away from oil-based fuels, particularly diesel used for on\u2011farm machinery. In the **Ampol-1p5DS** scenario, diesel consumption is largely displaced by electrification and emerging low\u2011emissions fuels, with electricity becoming the dominant energy carrier by mid\u2011century and a small but growing contribution from biomethane. In contrast, **Ampol-2p5DS** and **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View** retain a higher reliance on diesel, with slower growth in electricity use and minimal uptake of alternative fuels. Natural gas use remains a minor but persistent share of agricultural energy demand in all pathways, reflecting limited opportunities or slower substitution in some stationary applications.\n\n![Agriculture Energy Use by Fuel](figures/agriculture_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected agriculture final energy consumption by fuel and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (PJ).*\n\nThe energy pathways translate into markedly different outcomes for agriculture and land\u2011use emissions, once non\u2011energy sources (principally methane and nitrous oxide from livestock and soils) and land\u2011based sequestration are taken into account. Net agriculture and land\u2011use emissions in 2025 are 9.49 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e across all scenarios. Under **Ampol-1p5DS**, net emissions fall sharply to \u201170.26 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 (an 840.4% reduction), with the sector becoming a substantial net sink as afforestation, reforestation and improved land management more than offset residual agricultural emissions. The **Ampol-2p5DS** scenario shows an even larger net sink of \u201191.57 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 (a 1,064.9% reduction from 2025), reflecting stronger forestry and sequestration outcomes despite relatively higher energy use than in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway. In contrast, under **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View**, net emissions increase to 43.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050 (a 353.7% rise), leaving the sector as a growing net source. By 2050, net agriculture and land\u2011use emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 134.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in the 2.5\u00b0C pathway, illustrating the scale of the transition challenge.\n\n![Agriculture and Land Use Emissions](figures/agriculture_and_land_use_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Net agriculture and land\u2011use emissions by subsector and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), including sequestration from forestry and land management.*\n\nAchieving these emissions reductions relies heavily on non\u2011energy abatement measures, particularly methane mitigation in grazing systems, complemented by efficiency and precision agriculture that reduce emissions intensity per unit of output. By 2050, cumulative process-based abatement in **Ampol-1p5DS** reaches \u201124.99 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, compared with \u201122.11 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in **Ampol-2p5DS** and \u20119.93 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in **Ampol\u2011House\u2011View**. The difference between the reference/baseline case and the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway is 15.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, largely attributable to deeper deployment of methane reduction technologies in sheep and cattle herds, with additional contributions from dairy methane abatement and adoption of IT, automation and precision agriculture practices that lower non\u2011energy emissions intensity.\n\n![Agriculture Abatement By Process](figures/agriculture_abatement_by_process.png)  \n*Figure: Projected agriculture emissions abatement by process and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), highlighting the role of livestock methane mitigation and precision agriculture.*\n\nTaken together, the projections indicate that while total agricultural energy demand changes only moderately relative to other sectors (see discussion in the broader *Energy consumption by sector* section), the sector\u2019s emissions profile can shift from a material source to a net sink under ambitious decarbonisation pathways. This outcome depends on both continued improvements in energy efficiency and electrification and, critically, on large\u2011scale adoption of land\u2011use change, sequestration and non\u2011energy emissions abatement technologies."
