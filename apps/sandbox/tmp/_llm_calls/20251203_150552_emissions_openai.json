  "response": "Total national emissions across all scenarios start from a common baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to -71.48 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies net-negative emissions driven by large-scale removals and land sector sequestration. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)** approaches net zero by 2050, reaching 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e (a 99.1% reduction). In contrast, **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** only reduces emissions by 48.8%, to 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, leaving a 276.9 Mt CO\u2082-e gap to Ampol-1p5DS.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 across the three scenarios, highlighting the faster and deeper decarbonisation under Ampol-1p5DS.*\n\nThe distribution of reductions across sectors differs materially between scenarios. From the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers the largest overall cut, with cumulative sectoral changes totalling -472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e by 2050. Power generation is the single largest contributor (-128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e), followed by industry (-109.74 Mt CO\u2082-e) and transport (-94.07 Mt CO\u2082-e). **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves -397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e of total reductions, with power generation again dominant (-128.92 Mt CO\u2082-e) but a greater role for land use (-101.06 Mt CO\u2082-e). Under **Ampol-House-View**, aggregate reductions are more modest at -195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e; power generation still provides a substantial -127.83 Mt CO\u2082-e, but this is partly offset by a net increase in land use emissions of +33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Decomposition of emissions changes from 2025 to 2050 by major sector under each scenario, showing both reductions and increases.*\n\nDecarbonisation of electricity generation is rapid in all scenarios, but most complete under Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS. From 129.87 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, power sector emissions fall by 99.3% to 0.94 Mt CO\u2082-e in Ampol-1p5DS and to 0.95 Mt CO\u2082-e in Ampol-2p5DS by 2050. Ampol-House-View retains slightly higher residual emissions of 2.04 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050 (a 98.4% reduction), leaving a 1.1 Mt CO\u2082-e gap to the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure: Emissions from electricity generation by technology, showing near-elimination of emissions by 2050 in all scenarios, with the lowest residuals in Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS.*\n\nTransport is a key area of divergence. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** reduces domestic transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050, reflecting deep electrification and fuel switching across road, rail, aviation and shipping. Under **Ampol-2p5DS**, transport emissions fall more modestly, by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO\u2082-e. **Ampol-House-View** sees only a 21.4% reduction, with transport emissions still at 77.06 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2050\u201473.1 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than under Ampol-1p5DS\u2014indicating slower uptake of low\u2011emissions mobility options.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector from 2025 to 2050, illustrating much faster declines across all modes in Ampol-1p5DS relative to Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View.*\n\nEmissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) show similar patterns. From 14.25 Mt CO\u2082-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** achieves full decarbonisation of buildings by 2050 (0.0 Mt CO\u2082-e), consistent with widespread electrification and efficiency improvements. **Ampol-2p5DS** halves built environment emissions, to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082-e (a 49.3% reduction), while **Ampol-House-View** achieves a 34.6% reduction, to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082-e. The 2050 gap between the reference pathway and Ampol-1p5DS is 9.3 Mt CO\u2082-e.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions to 2050, highlighting full phase-out in Ampol-1p5DS compared with partial reductions in Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View.*\n\nTogether, these projections show that achieving a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned outcome relies on near-complete decarbonisation of power, transport and buildings, combined with significant industrial abatement and net removals from land use and engineered carbon dioxide removal. The reference pathway leaves substantial residual emissions in 2050 across these sectors, underscoring the scale of additional action required beyond business-as-usual."
