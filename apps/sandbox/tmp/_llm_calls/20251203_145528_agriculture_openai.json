  "response": "Agricultural energy demand remains relatively stable over the projection period, with modest reductions in total final energy alongside a shift in the fuel mix. Across all scenarios, sectoral energy use starts at 107.69 PJ in 2025. In the **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway)**, total agriculture energy use declines by 17.6% to 88.75 PJ by 2050, reflecting stronger efficiency gains and fuel switching. Under the **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5\u00b0C pathway)**, energy use falls more gradually to 99.56 PJ (\u20117.5%), while in the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** it remains broadly flat, reaching 101.1 PJ in 2050 (\u20116.1%). By 2050, the reference pathway therefore uses 12.3 PJ more energy than the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway.\n\nThe composition of agricultural energy demand diverges markedly between scenarios. In Ampol-1p5DS, diesel use falls sharply over the outlook, with electricity and a small but growing contribution from biofuels/biomethane displacing liquid fuels in on-farm machinery and stationary uses. In contrast, Ampol-2.5DS and Ampol-House-View preserve a higher share of diesel, with only moderate electrification and limited uptake of low\u2011emissions gaseous fuels. Natural gas remains a minor contributor in all scenarios, primarily for specialised stationary applications. These trends are consistent with the broader sectoral patterns of electrification and fuel substitution discussed elsewhere in this report.\n\n![Agriculture Energy Use by Fuel](figures/agriculture_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  \n*Figure: Projected agriculture final energy use by fuel and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (PJ). The 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway shows the strongest overall reduction and the most pronounced shift away from diesel towards electricity and low\u2011emissions fuels.*\n\nWhen energy and non\u2011energy sources of emissions are combined with land use and forestry, agriculture\u2019s net climate impact varies substantially between pathways. In 2025, net agriculture and land use emissions are 9.49 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e across all scenarios. By 2050, both transition pathways transform the sector into a substantial net sink: **\u201170.26 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u20111p5DS and **\u201191.57 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u20112.5DS. These large percentage reductions (\u2011840% and \u20111,065% respectively) are driven by a combination of reduced methane and nitrous oxide from livestock and soils, and significant carbon sequestration from forestry and land-use change that more than offsets residual emissions. In contrast, under Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, net agriculture and land use emissions rise to **43.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** by 2050, ending 134.6 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than the Ampol\u20112.5DS pathway, highlighting the central role of land-sector policy and practice in achieving economy\u2011wide decarbonisation.\n\n![Agriculture and Land Use Emissions](figures/agriculture_and_land_use_emissions.png)  \n*Figure: Net agriculture and land use emissions by sub\u2011sector and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Negative values indicate net removals from forestry and land-based sequestration exceeding gross agricultural emissions.*\n\nAchieving these deep reductions relies heavily on process\u2011level abatement rather than energy demand alone. By 2050, total modelled abatement from agriculture processes reaches **\u201124.99 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u20111p5DS and **\u201122.11 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u20112.5DS, compared with **\u20119.93 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e** in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View. The dominant levers across the transition pathways are methane mitigation measures in sheep and cattle enterprises, complemented by targeted methane reduction in dairy and improved non\u2011energy emissions intensity through precision and digital agriculture. These measures, together with land-use and forestry dynamics, underpin the strong decoupling of agricultural output from emissions in the transition scenarios, even as the sector\u2019s final energy consumption declines only moderately.\n\n![Agriculture Abatement By Process](figures/agriculture_abatement_by_process.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative agriculture abatement by process and scenario, 2025\u20132050 (Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Methane mitigation in livestock and precision agriculture drive the majority of emissions reductions, particularly in the transition pathways.*"
