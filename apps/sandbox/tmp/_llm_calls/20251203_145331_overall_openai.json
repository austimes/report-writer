  "response": "Across all scenarios, total electricity consumption more than doubles from 2025 to 2050, underscoring the central role of electrification in the energy transition. From a common 2025 baseline of 355.36 TWh, electricity demand reaches 719.75 TWh in **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario), 780.55 TWh in **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5\u00b0C pathway), and 1,019.51 TWh in **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway) by 2050. This corresponds to growth of 102.5%, 119.7% and 186.9% respectively, with the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway requiring around 300 TWh more electricity in 2050 than the reference case, driven by deeper electrification in transport, industry and new loads such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide removal.\n\n![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector from 2025 to 2050 under the three scenarios, showing substantially higher demand in the more ambitious decarbonisation pathways.*\n\nDespite this strong growth in electricity use, net emissions decline sharply in the decarbonisation scenarios. All pathways start from the same 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e. By 2050, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers net-negative emissions of \u221271.48 Mt CO\u2082-e (a 117.8% reduction relative to 2025), while **Ampol-2p5DS** almost fully decarbonises to 3.52 Mt CO\u2082-e (a 99.1% reduction). In contrast, **Ampol-House-View** reduces emissions only to 205.41 Mt CO\u2082-e, a 48.8% reduction, leaving 205 Mt CO\u2082-e of residual emissions in 2050\u2014around 277 Mt CO\u2082-e higher than the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathway. This indicates that achieving higher climate ambition requires not only increased electrification but also a rapid shift to low\u2011emissions electricity supply and complementary abatement in non\u2011power sectors.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Net emissions trajectories by sector for each scenario, highlighting the progression from positive to net\u2011negative emissions in the 1.5\u00b0C\u2011aligned pathway.*\n\nSectoral contributions to emissions reduction further illustrate the scale of system change implied by the higher-ambition pathways. From the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** achieves the deepest total cut (\u2212472.53 Mt CO\u2082-e), followed by **Ampol-2p5DS** (\u2212397.51 Mt CO\u2082-e) and **Ampol-House-View** (\u2212195.63 Mt CO\u2082-e). Power Generation is the single largest source of abatement in all scenarios, delivering about 129 Mt CO\u2082-e of reductions, with substantial additional cuts from Industry and Transport. Land Use acts as a significant sink in **Ampol-2p5DS** (\u2212101.06 Mt CO\u2082-e) and **Ampol-1p5DS**, but becomes a net source in **Ampol-House-View**, where Land Use emissions increase by 33.58 Mt CO\u2082-e. Overall, the projections show that higher electricity consumption is compatible with deep emissions reductions, provided that the power system decarbonises rapidly and that industry, transport and land sectors deliver sustained mitigation.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure: Cumulative emissions reductions by sector between 2025 and 2050, relative to the 2025 baseline, indicating the relative contribution of each sector under the three scenarios.*"
