  "response": "## Emissions\n\nProjected emissions trajectories diverge materially across the three scenarios, despite a common 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e. Under the Ampol\u20111p5DS and Ampol\u20112p5DS pathways, economy\u2011wide emissions fall by 117.8% and 99.1% respectively between 2025 and 2050, with Ampol\u20111p5DS reaching net\u2011negative emissions of \u201171.48 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e by 2050. In contrast, the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View delivers a more moderate 48.8% reduction, with net emissions of 205.41 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050\u2014276.9 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS.\n\n![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure 1: Net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 under the three scenarios, showing the depth and timing of decarbonisation and the emergence of net\u2011negative emissions in Ampol\u20111p5DS.*\n\n### Sectoral contributions to emissions outcomes\n\nAll scenarios start from the same 2025 baseline but differ in the scale and composition of reductions. In Ampol\u20111p5DS, cumulative reductions to 2050 total 472.53 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e relative to the 2025 level, driven primarily by Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), Industry (\u2011109.74 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Transport (\u201194.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e). Ampol\u20112p5DS achieves a smaller but still substantial total reduction of 397.51 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, with Power Generation (\u2011128.92 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Land Use (\u2011101.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) making the largest contributions. The Ampol\u2011House\u2011View pathway delivers 195.63 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e of total abatement; while Power Generation (\u2011127.83 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) and Industry (\u201172.37 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e) still decarbonise materially, these gains are partly offset by a net increase in Land Use emissions of 33.58 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e.\n\n![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  \n*Figure 2: Sectoral contributions to cumulative emissions changes from the 2025 baseline, highlighting the dominance of power, industry and transport abatement and the positive land\u2011use emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View.*\n\n### Electricity generation\n\nElectricity decarbonisation is rapid in all cases. From a 2025 level of 129.87 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, emissions from electricity generation fall by 99.3% in both Ampol\u20111p5DS and Ampol\u20112p5DS, reaching 0.94 and 0.95 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e respectively by 2050. The Ampol\u2011House\u2011View pathway is only marginally higher at 2.04 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050 (a 98.4% reduction). This near\u2011complete phase\u2011out of power sector emissions underpins much of the economy\u2011wide abatement and enables electrification\u2011led reductions in other sectors.\n\n![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  \n*Figure 3: Emissions from electricity generation by technology, showing a near\u2011total phase\u2011out of fossil\u2011based generation by 2050 across all scenarios.*\n\n### Domestic transport\n\nTransport outcomes diverge sharply between scenarios. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2025, domestic transport emissions in Ampol\u20111p5DS fall by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, reflecting extensive electrification and efficiency improvements across road, rail, aviation and shipping. Ampol\u20112p5DS achieves a 55.7% reduction over the period, with emissions of 43.42 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050. Under the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View, slower uptake of low\u2011emissions technologies limits progress: emissions decline by only 21.4% to 77.06 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e in 2050, leaving the sector 73.1 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS.\n\n![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  \n*Figure 4: Domestic transport emissions by subsector, illustrating the much deeper and broader decarbonisation of road and non\u2011road transport in Ampol\u20111p5DS relative to the other scenarios.*\n\n### Built environment\n\nEmissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) also show scenario\u2011dependent trajectories. From a 2025 level of 14.25 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e, Ampol\u20111p5DS delivers full decarbonisation by 2050 (0.0 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e), consistent with widespread building electrification and efficiency upgrades. Ampol\u20112p5DS halves emissions to 7.22 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201149.3%), while the Ampol\u2011House\u2011View pathway achieves a more modest decline to 9.32 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e (\u201134.6%). By 2050, built environment emissions in Ampol\u2011House\u2011View are 9.3 Mt CO\u2082\u2011e higher than in Ampol\u20111p5DS.\n\n![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  \n*Figure 5: Residential and commercial building emissions trajectories, showing complete elimination of direct emissions by 2050 only in the Ampol\u20111p5DS scenario.*\n\nOverall, the projections highlight that achieving net\u2011zero and net\u2011negative outcomes by mid\u2011century requires not only near\u2011complete decarbonisation of electricity, but also deep and sustained emissions reductions in transport, industry, buildings and land use."
