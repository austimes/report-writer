Net national emissions across all sectors decline from 401.05 Mt CO₂-e in 2025 in every scenario, but with markedly different end-states. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to ‑71.48 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies a net‑negative system. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway)** almost fully abates emissions, reaching 3.52 Mt CO₂-e in 2050 (‑99.1%), while the **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** still emits 205.41 Mt CO₂-e in 2050 (‑48.8%). By 2050, the gap between Ampol‑House‑View and Ampol‑1p5DS is 276.9 Mt CO₂-e, highlighting the scale of additional abatement and removals required in a 1.5°C-aligned trajectory.

The distribution of reductions across sectors varies between pathways, but power generation is consistently the single largest source of abatement. From a 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e, **Ampol‑1p5DS** delivers total reductions of 472.53 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, led by Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂-e), Industry (‑109.74 Mt CO₂-e) and Transport (‑94.07 Mt CO₂-e). **Ampol‑2p5DS** achieves 397.51 Mt CO₂-e of reductions, with Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂-e), Land Use (‑101.06 Mt CO₂-e) and Industry (‑97.01 Mt CO₂-e) providing most of the abatement. In the **Ampol‑House‑View** scenario, total reductions are more modest at 195.63 Mt CO₂-e: Power Generation (‑127.83 Mt CO₂-e) and Industry (‑72.37 Mt CO₂-e) still decarbonise substantially, but Transport reductions are limited (‑21.01 Mt CO₂-e) and Land Use emissions increase by 33.58 Mt CO₂-e, offsetting progress elsewhere.

Electricity generation decarbonises rapidly in all scenarios, reflecting strong structural change in the power system (discussed in the energy supply section). From 129.87 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, emissions fall by 99.3% under both **Ampol‑1p5DS** and **Ampol‑2p5DS**, reaching 0.94 and 0.95 Mt CO₂-e respectively in 2050. Even in **Ampol‑House‑View**, power sector emissions decline by 98.4% to 2.04 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, leaving only a small residual difference of 1.1 Mt CO₂-e compared with Ampol‑1p5DS.

In **domestic transport**, the divergence between scenarios is much more pronounced. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, **Ampol‑1p5DS** cuts domestic transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, implying near‑full decarbonisation across road, rail, aviation and shipping subsectors. Under **Ampol‑2p5DS**, emissions fall by only 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO₂-e, and in **Ampol‑House‑View** by just 21.4% to 77.06 Mt CO₂-e. By 2050, domestic transport emissions in the reference pathway are 73.1 Mt CO₂-e higher than in Ampol‑1p5DS, underscoring the critical role of accelerated electrification, alternative fuels and efficiency improvements explored in the transport section.

The **built environment** shows a similar pattern of divergence. In 2025, residential and commercial buildings together emit 14.25 Mt CO₂-e. Under **Ampol‑1p5DS**, these emissions decline steadily to zero by 2050, achieving a 100% reduction and eliminating direct emissions from the built environment. **Ampol‑2p5DS** delivers a 49.3% reduction, to 7.22 Mt CO₂-e, while **Ampol‑House‑View** achieves a 34.6% reduction, to 9.32 Mt CO₂-e. As a result, 2050 emissions from buildings in the reference scenario are 9.3 Mt CO₂-e higher than in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway, with both residential and commercial segments falling short of full decarbonisation.

Taken together, the projections indicate that achieving a 1.5°C‑aligned outcome relies on: (i) rapid, near‑complete decarbonisation of power, buildings and domestic transport; (ii) deep industrial abatement; and (iii) substantial net removals and land sector improvements. In contrast, the Ampol‑House‑View pathway locks in significantly higher residual emissions to 2050, particularly from transport, buildings and land use.
