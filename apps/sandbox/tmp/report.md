Projected emissions trajectories diverge materially across the three scenarios, all of which start from the same 2025 net emissions level of 401.05 Mt CO₂‑e. Under the Ampol‑1p5DS (1.5°C‑aligned pathway), total abatement over the projection period reaches 472.53 Mt CO₂‑e, with the largest contributions from Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂‑e), Industry (‑109.74 Mt CO₂‑e) and Transport (‑94.07 Mt CO₂‑e). The Ampol‑2p5DS (2.5°C pathway) also relies heavily on Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂‑e) but allocates a greater share of reductions to Land Use (‑101.06 Mt CO₂‑e). In contrast, the Ampol‑House‑View (reference/baseline scenario) delivers more modest cuts (total reduction of 195.63 Mt CO₂‑e), with Power Generation (‑127.83 Mt CO₂‑e) and Industry (‑72.37 Mt CO₂‑e) partly offset by a net increase in Land Use emissions of 33.58 Mt CO₂‑e.

*Figure: Projected cumulative emissions reductions by sector from the 2025 baseline under each scenario, highlighting the dominant role of Power Generation and contrasting Land Use outcomes.*

These sectoral shifts translate into significantly different net emissions outcomes by 2050. In the Ampol‑1p5DS scenario, total net emissions fall from 401.05 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to ‑71.48 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies the economy becomes a net sink by mid‑century. The Ampol‑2p5DS pathway approaches net zero, reducing emissions by 99.1% to 3.52 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050. Under Ampol‑House‑View, progress is slower: net emissions decline by 48.8% to 205.41 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050. As a result, 2050 emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 276.9 Mt CO₂‑e higher than in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway, underscoring the scale of additional decarbonisation required to align with a 1.5°C outcome.

*Figure: Net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 under each scenario, showing the overall downward trajectory and the extent to which the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway achieves net negative emissions.*

Achieving the deeper emissions cuts in Ampol‑1p5DS and Ampol‑2p5DS is closely linked to accelerated electrification. Total electricity consumption rises from 355.36 TWh in 2025 to 1,019.51 TWh in 2050 under Ampol‑1p5DS, an increase of 186.9%. The Ampol‑2p5DS scenario records a 119.7% increase to 780.55 TWh, while Ampol‑House‑View grows by 102.5% to 719.75 TWh. By 2050, electricity demand in Ampol‑1p5DS is 299.8 TWh higher than in the reference/baseline scenario, reflecting greater substitution of fossil fuels with low‑emissions electricity across transport, industry and buildings. These projections highlight the dual requirement of rapidly decarbonising power generation and expanding electricity supply to support economy‑wide emissions reductions.

Total national emissions across all scenarios start from a common baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e in 2025. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to -71.48 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies net-negative emissions driven by large-scale removals and land sector sequestration. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway)** approaches net zero by 2050, reaching 3.52 Mt CO₂-e (a 99.1% reduction). In contrast, **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** only reduces emissions by 48.8%, to 205.41 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, leaving a 276.9 Mt CO₂-e gap to Ampol-1p5DS.

![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  
*Figure: Projected net emissions by sector from 2025 to 2050 across the three scenarios, highlighting the faster and deeper decarbonisation under Ampol-1p5DS.*

The distribution of reductions across sectors differs materially between scenarios. From the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers the largest overall cut, with cumulative sectoral changes totalling -472.53 Mt CO₂-e by 2050. Power generation is the single largest contributor (-128.92 Mt CO₂-e), followed by industry (-109.74 Mt CO₂-e) and transport (-94.07 Mt CO₂-e). **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves -397.51 Mt CO₂-e of total reductions, with power generation again dominant (-128.92 Mt CO₂-e) but a greater role for land use (-101.06 Mt CO₂-e). Under **Ampol-House-View**, aggregate reductions are more modest at -195.63 Mt CO₂-e; power generation still provides a substantial -127.83 Mt CO₂-e, but this is partly offset by a net increase in land use emissions of +33.58 Mt CO₂-e.

![Emissions Reduction by Sector](figures/emissions_reduction_by_sector.png)  
*Figure: Decomposition of emissions changes from 2025 to 2050 by major sector under each scenario, showing both reductions and increases.*

Decarbonisation of electricity generation is rapid in all scenarios, but most complete under Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS. From 129.87 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, power sector emissions fall by 99.3% to 0.94 Mt CO₂-e in Ampol-1p5DS and to 0.95 Mt CO₂-e in Ampol-2p5DS by 2050. Ampol-House-View retains slightly higher residual emissions of 2.04 Mt CO₂-e in 2050 (a 98.4% reduction), leaving a 1.1 Mt CO₂-e gap to the 1.5°C-aligned pathway.

![Emissions from Electricity Generation](figures/emissions_from_electricity_generation.png)  
*Figure: Emissions from electricity generation by technology, showing near-elimination of emissions by 2050 in all scenarios, with the lowest residuals in Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS.*

Transport is a key area of divergence. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** reduces domestic transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, reflecting deep electrification and fuel switching across road, rail, aviation and shipping. Under **Ampol-2p5DS**, transport emissions fall more modestly, by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO₂-e. **Ampol-House-View** sees only a 21.4% reduction, with transport emissions still at 77.06 Mt CO₂-e in 2050—73.1 Mt CO₂-e higher than under Ampol-1p5DS—indicating slower uptake of low‑emissions mobility options.

![Domestic Transport Emissions by Subsector](figures/domestic_transport_emissions_by_subsector.png)  
*Figure: Domestic transport emissions by subsector from 2025 to 2050, illustrating much faster declines across all modes in Ampol-1p5DS relative to Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View.*

Emissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) show similar patterns. From 14.25 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** achieves full decarbonisation of buildings by 2050 (0.0 Mt CO₂-e), consistent with widespread electrification and efficiency improvements. **Ampol-2p5DS** halves built environment emissions, to 7.22 Mt CO₂-e (a 49.3% reduction), while **Ampol-House-View** achieves a 34.6% reduction, to 9.32 Mt CO₂-e. The 2050 gap between the reference pathway and Ampol-1p5DS is 9.3 Mt CO₂-e.

![Built Environment Emissions](figures/built_environment_emissions.png)  
*Figure: Residential and commercial building emissions to 2050, highlighting full phase-out in Ampol-1p5DS compared with partial reductions in Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View.*

Together, these projections show that achieving a 1.5°C-aligned outcome relies on near-complete decarbonisation of power, transport and buildings, combined with significant industrial abatement and net removals from land use and engineered carbon dioxide removal. The reference pathway leaves substantial residual emissions in 2050 across these sectors, underscoring the scale of additional action required beyond business-as-usual.

Electricity generation increases substantially across all scenarios to meet growing electrification and economic activity. Total annual generation rises from 266 TWh in 2025 to 1,472 TWh in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (a 453% increase) and to 1,347 TWh in Ampol-2p5DS (406% increase). Even under the Ampol-House-View, generation more than quadruples to 1,095 TWh by 2050 (311% increase). By 2050, electricity output in Ampol-1p5DS is 377 TWh higher than in the Ampol-House-View, reflecting deeper electrification and faster fuel switching in the 1.5°C-aligned pathway.

![Electricity Generation Energy](figures/electricity_generation_energy.png)  
*Figure: Projected electricity generation by technology across scenarios, showing strong growth in total output and a shift towards variable renewables.*

The expansion in generation is enabled by a large build-out of installed capacity. Aggregate capacity grows from 110 GW in 2025 to 720 GW in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (a 552% increase) and 625 GW in Ampol-2p5DS (466% increase). In the Ampol-House-View, capacity still increases to 559 GW by 2050 (406% increase). Ampol-1p5DS therefore requires around 160 GW more capacity than the reference scenario in 2050, driven primarily by additional wind and solar plant. Across all scenarios, the mix shifts decisively away from coal and unabated gas towards wind, utility-scale solar and rooftop solar, with residual thermal plant primarily providing flexibility and backup.

![Electricity Generation Capacity by Tech and Fuel](figures/electricity_generation_capacity_by_tech_and_fuel.png)  
*Figure: Installed generation capacity by technology and fuel, highlighting the rapid scale-up of wind and solar capacity, particularly in the Ampol-1p5DS scenario.*

The system undergoes a rapid and near-complete transition to renewable electricity. The renewable energy fraction increases from around 38% in 2025 to effectively 100% by 2050 in all scenarios. Ampol-1p5DS reaches 99.8–99.9% renewables by 2050, marginally above Ampol-2p5DS (99.8%) and the Ampol-House-View (99.7%). Differences between scenarios are therefore driven less by the eventual level of decarbonisation and more by the timing and scale of the build-out.

![Renewable Energy Fraction](figures/renewable_energy_fraction.png)  
*Figure: Share of electricity generation from renewable sources, demonstrating convergence to a near-100% renewable system across all scenarios.*

Consistent with this shift, the emissions intensity of electricity generation falls sharply. Average lifecycle emissions intensity declines from around 0.51 Mt CO₂-e/TWh in 2025 to zero by 2050 in all three scenarios, implying the phase-out or full abatement of fossil-based generation. The timing of the decline is fastest in Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS, supporting the earlier and deeper system-wide emissions reductions discussed in the emissions projections section.

![Generation Emissions Intensity by Tech](figures/generation_emissions_intensity_by_tech.png)  
*Figure: Average emissions intensity of grid electricity, showing a steep decline to net-zero by 2050 in all scenarios.*

To maintain reliability in a highly renewable system, electricity storage capacity grows even more rapidly than generation capacity. Total storage expands from 4.3 GW in 2025 to 71.8 GW in 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (an increase of over 1,550%), compared with 48.6 GW in Ampol-2p5DS (1,021% increase) and 38.3 GW in the Ampol-House-View (785% increase). Utility-scale batteries constitute the majority of this capacity, supplemented by residential and commercial batteries and incremental hydro storage. By 2050, storage capacity in Ampol-1p5DS is about 33.5 GW higher than in the reference scenario, reflecting the greater flexibility requirements of the more ambitious decarbonisation pathway.

Across all scenarios, total final energy consumption shifts markedly towards electricity and low‑emissions fuels, even as aggregate industrial energy use declines over the projection period.

Total electricity consumption across sectors rises from 355.36 TWh in 2025 to 1,019.51 TWh in 2050 under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway)**, an increase of 186.9%. The **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway)** and **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** show more moderate growth, reaching 780.55 TWh (+119.7%) and 719.75 TWh (+102.5%) respectively by 2050. By the end of the outlook period, electricity demand in Ampol-1p5DS is 299.8 TWh higher than in Ampol-House-View, reflecting deeper electrification of transport, buildings and industry, and additional load from emerging sectors such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide removal.

![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  
*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector under each scenario, highlighting stronger growth in electricity demand under the 1.5°C-aligned pathway as transport, buildings and industrial processes electrify and new electricity‑intensive activities emerge.*

In contrast to the strong growth in electricity demand, total final energy use in industry declines in all scenarios. From a common 2025 baseline of 1,555.51 PJ, industrial energy consumption falls to 1,179.22 PJ in 2050 in **Ampol-1p5DS** (a 24.2% reduction), 1,089.19 PJ in **Ampol-2p5DS** (‑30.0%), and 1,164.28 PJ in **Ampol-House-View** (‑25.2%). The steeper reduction in Ampol-2p5DS reflects more pronounced efficiency gains and fuel savings, while the slightly higher 2050 level in Ampol-1p5DS (90.0 PJ above Ampol-2p5DS) is associated with increased use of electricity, hydrogen and other low‑carbon fuels to support deeper emissions abatement.

![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  
*Figure: Industrial final energy consumption by fuel type, showing declining use of natural gas, coal and diesel across all scenarios, partially offset by higher consumption of electricity and low‑emissions fuels such as hydrogen, biomass and biomethane, particularly in the 1.5°C-aligned pathway.*

Across all scenarios, overall energy use is characterised by strong electrification alongside deep, but variable, emissions reductions. Total electricity consumption more than doubles from 355.36 TWh in 2025 in every case, reaching 1,019.51 TWh by 2050 in **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5°C-aligned pathway), 780.55 TWh in **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5°C pathway), and 719.75 TWh in **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario). This represents growth of 186.9%, 119.7% and 102.5% respectively, with the 1.5°C-aligned pathway requiring around 300 TWh more electricity than the reference case by 2050, reflecting greater fuel switching and electrification across transport, industry and buildings.

![Electricity consumption by sector](figures/electricity_consumption_by_sector.png)  
*Figure: Projected electricity consumption by sector under the three scenarios, 2025–2050 (TWh).*

Despite this strong growth in electricity demand, total net emissions fall sharply from 401.05 Mt CO₂-e in 2025 in all decarbonisation scenarios. **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers the most ambitious outcome, reaching net negative emissions of -71.48 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction from 2025 levels. **Ampol-2p5DS** reduces emissions by 99.1% to 3.52 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, effectively achieving net-zero. In contrast, **Ampol-House-View** achieves a 48.8% reduction, with residual emissions of 205.41 Mt CO₂-e in 2050—around 276.9 Mt CO₂-e higher than the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, underscoring the scale of additional abatement required beyond the reference trajectory.

![Net Emissions by Sector](figures/net_emissions_by_sector.png)  
*Figure: Net emissions by sector under the three scenarios, 2025–2050 (Mt CO₂-e).*

The decomposition of abatement highlights that power generation, industry and transport drive the majority of emissions reductions. From a 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers total cuts of -472.53 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, led by power generation (-128.92 Mt), industry (-109.74 Mt) and transport (-94.07 Mt). **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves -397.51 Mt CO₂-e of reductions, again with power generation (~-129 Mt) as the largest single contributor, followed by land use (-101.06 Mt) and industry (-97.01 Mt). Under **Ampol-House-View**, total reductions are more modest at -195.63 Mt CO₂-e and are partially offset by a net increase in land-use emissions (+33.58 Mt CO₂-e), leaving greater reliance on ongoing fossil fuel use and slower structural change. Detailed sectoral drivers of these trends are discussed in the subsequent sub-sections.

Domestic transport is a major driver of final energy demand, and the scenarios show a wide divergence in long‑term outcomes. In the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway), total domestic transport energy use declines from 1,447 PJ in 2025 to 840 PJ in 2050, a 42% reduction. Under Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway), demand falls more moderately to 1,081 PJ by 2050 (–25.3%), while in Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario) overall domestic transport energy remains effectively flat, ending at 1,450 PJ (+0.2%). By 2050, this leaves domestic transport in Ampol-House-View consuming around 610 PJ more energy than in Ampol-1p5DS.

![Domestic Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/domestic_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)
*Figure: Projected domestic transport final energy use by fuel under each scenario, highlighting faster displacement of oil products by electricity, hydrogen and biofuels in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway.*

Road transport, the largest subsector, accounts for most of this change. In Ampol-1p5DS, road transport energy demand halves over the projection period, falling from 1,177 PJ in 2025 to 557 PJ in 2050 (–52.7%). Ampol-2p5DS shows a smaller decline to 675 PJ (–42.6%), whereas Ampol-House-View only reduces road energy demand to 1,068 PJ by 2050 (–9.3%). As a result, road transport energy use in 2050 is about 510 PJ higher in Ampol-House-View than in Ampol-1p5DS. Across the decarbonisation scenarios, oil-based fuels (diesel and petrol) contract sharply and are progressively replaced by electricity, biofuels and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen.

![Road Transport Energy Use by Fuel](figures/road_transport_energy_use_by_fuel.png)
*Figure: Road transport energy consumption by fuel, showing deep reductions in oil demand and strong electrification under Ampol-1p5DS compared with a more gradual transition in Ampol-2p5DS and sustained liquid fuel demand in Ampol-House-View.*

The evolution of new vehicle sales underpins these energy trajectories. In Ampol-1p5DS, combustion engine vehicles rapidly lose market share, with battery electric drivetrains (including long-range and autonomous electric vehicles) dominating new sales by the late 2030s. Ampol-2p5DS exhibits a slower but still material shift, with combustion engines persisting in a non-trivial share of sales into the 2040s. In contrast, Ampol-House-View retains a high proportion of internal combustion engine sales through to 2050, with low penetration of zero-emissions drivetrains. These differences in technology uptake directly drive the pace of fuel switching and efficiency gains in road transport.

![New Vehicle Sales by Drivetrain](figures/new_vehicle_sales_by_drivetrain.png)
*Figure: Shares of new light and heavy road vehicle sales by drivetrain type, indicating the speed and depth of electrification and alternative drivetrains across scenarios.*

Changes in fleet composition lag changes in new sales but follow a similar pattern. Under Ampol-1p5DS, the stock of combustion engine vehicles declines steadily as electrified and fuel cell vehicles diffuse through the fleet, reaching a predominantly zero-emissions road vehicle stock by 2050. Ampol-2p5DS still achieves a substantial shift away from combustion engines but retains a sizeable share of legacy vehicles at mid‑century. Under Ampol-House-View, combustion engine vehicles remain the dominant share of the road fleet in 2050, constraining reductions in both energy demand and emissions.

![Road Vehicle Stock by drivetrain](figures/road_vehicle_stock_by_drivetrain.png)
*Figure: Road vehicle stock by drivetrain type, illustrating fleet turnover dynamics and the slower decarbonisation of the in‑use fleet relative to new sales, particularly in the baseline scenario.*

The combined effect of reduced energy demand and fuel switching is reflected in domestic transport emissions. In Ampol-1p5DS, domestic transport emissions fall from 98.1 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to just 4.0 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, a 95.9% reduction, with all subsectors—including passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, trucks and aviation—converging towards very low emissions. Ampol-2p5DS achieves a 55.7% decline to 43.4 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050, while Ampol-House-View delivers only a 21.4% reduction to 77.1 Mt CO₂‑e. The gap between Ampol-House-View and Ampol-1p5DS reaches 73.1 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, underlining the critical role of rapid transport decarbonisation in meeting economy-wide emissions objectives discussed in the emissions section of this report.

Industrial final energy demand declines materially across all scenarios, while emissions fall more rapidly as fuel switching and process changes take effect. Total industry energy use is projected to fall from 1,555 PJ in 2025 to between 1,089 PJ (Ampol-2p5DS, 2.5°C pathway) and 1,179 PJ (Ampol-1p5DS, 1.5°C‑aligned pathway) by 2050, a reduction of 24–30%. The reference/baseline scenario Ampol-House-View is similar, reaching 1,164 PJ by 2050 (‑25.2%). Despite comparable aggregate reductions, the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway maintains around 90 PJ more industrial energy use than the 2.5°C pathway in 2050, reflecting higher residual activity and deeper electrification.

![Industry Energy Use by Fuel](figures/industry_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  
*Figure: Projected final energy use in industry by fuel under the three scenarios, showing declining overall demand and a shift away from fossil fuels.*

The fuel mix shifts markedly over the projection period. Across all scenarios, the reliance on natural gas and coal in industry declines, displaced by electricity, biomass, emerging low‑emission fuels and direct electrification technologies. This is most pronounced in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway, where stronger decarbonisation of heat and processes leads to faster reductions in fossil fuel use but maintains overall energy requirements due to efficiency penalties associated with some low‑emissions technologies. These fuel‑mix changes are consistent with the broader electrification trends highlighted in other sectors of this report.

The iron and steel subsector illustrates the divergence between pathways. Starting from 98.7 PJ in 2025, iron and steel energy use grows to 166.1 PJ by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS, a 68.3% increase, driven by a transition toward electricity, natural gas and hydrogen-based production routes. By contrast, energy use falls sharply to 28.5 PJ in Ampol-2p5DS (‑71.1%) and to 68.9 PJ in Ampol-House-View (‑30.2%), indicating lower production volumes and slower adoption of new technologies relative to the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway.

![Iron and Steel Energy Use by Fuel](figures/iron_and_steel_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  
*Figure: Iron and steel sector energy use by fuel, highlighting growth and strong fuel switching in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway versus contraction in other scenarios.*

While energy use falls moderately, industrial greenhouse gas emissions decline much more steeply, underscoring the importance of decarbonising fuels and processes. Aggregate industry emissions fall from 146.8 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (‑74.8%), and to 49.8 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS (‑66.1%). Under Ampol-House-View, emissions decline less, to 74.4 Mt CO₂‑e (‑49.3%), leaving 2050 emissions 37.4 Mt CO₂‑e higher than in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway. The sharper reductions in Ampol-1p5DS reflect faster phase‑out of fossil fuels, process changes in emissions‑intensive subsectors and earlier deployment of low‑emissions technologies, with only limited contributions from captured emissions.

![Industry Emissions and Captured Emissions](figures/industry_emissions_and_captured_emissions.png)  
*Figure: Total industry emissions, split between process and combustion sources, with captured emissions and net emissions for each scenario.*

Within manufacturing, emissions reductions are substantial in the decarbonisation pathways but more muted in the reference case. Total manufacturing emissions fall from 61.0 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (‑59.7%) and to 31.3 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS (‑48.7%). In contrast, the Ampol-House-View scenario records only a modest decline to 51.0 Mt CO₂‑e (‑16.4%), remaining 26.4 Mt CO₂‑e above the 1.5°C‑aligned outcome in 2050. The largest absolute reductions occur in iron and steel, alumina and cement, where a combination of fuel switching, efficiency and process innovation materially lowers emissions. Other subsectors, such as food and beverages and paper products, see smaller but still meaningful declines, primarily through improved efficiency and increased electrification.

Carbon capture in the chemical sector plays a limited but distinct role. In Ampol-2p5DS, captured emissions from chemical processes reach around 1.0 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 (net emissions of ‑1.04 Mt CO₂‑e), with capture applied to coal and natural‑gas‑based production routes and urea production. This contrasts with the Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-House-View scenarios, where chemical sector captured emissions remain close to zero by 2050. As a result, 2050 chemical captured emissions in Ampol-House-View are around 1.0 Mt CO₂‑e higher (i.e. less negative) than in Ampol-2p5DS.

*Figure: Captured emissions from key chemical processes, showing the deployment of carbon capture in the 2.5°C pathway relative to minimal uptake in other scenarios.*

Overall, the industrial sector’s projections indicate that deep emissions reductions are achievable with only moderate declines in total energy use, provided there is sustained investment in electrification, fuel switching and process innovation—particularly in hard‑to‑abate subsectors such as iron and steel, alumina and cement.

Residential energy use remains broadly stable over the projection period, with only modest reductions in total final energy despite substantial growth in dwelling stock. Across all scenarios, total residential energy consumption declines from 508.9 PJ in 2025 to around 481–483 PJ in 2050, a reduction of 5.1–5.5%. The Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway) falls to 482.7 PJ by 2050 (‑5.1%), Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway) to 482.0 PJ (‑5.3%), and Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario) to 481.1 PJ (‑5.5%). By 2050, the 1.5°C-aligned pathway remains only 1.6 PJ above the baseline, indicating that decarbonisation is driven more by fuel switching and emissions intensity improvements than by reductions in delivered energy.

Across all scenarios, electricity becomes the dominant energy carrier for households. Direct electricity and “Electricity – Electrification” increase their combined share of final energy, offsetting declines in natural gas use for space and water heating. LPG plays a relatively minor role and contracts over time. Low‑carbon fuels (biomethane and hydrogen) contribute a small but growing share of residual gaseous demand toward 2050, particularly in the Ampol-1p5DS scenario. These trends indicate widespread appliance electrification and improved building and equipment efficiency, while maintaining service levels in a larger housing stock.

*Figure: Projected residential final energy use by fuel from 2025 to 2050 under the three scenarios, showing stable total demand with a pronounced shift from natural gas to electricity and emerging low‑carbon gases.*

The change in fuel mix translates into significant emissions reductions from the residential component of the built environment. Under Ampol-1p5DS, total built environment emissions (residential plus commercial) fall from 14.25 Mt CO₂-e in 2025 to zero by 2050, implying full decarbonisation of residential energy services in line with the 1.5°C objective. In Ampol-2p5DS, built environment emissions decline by 49.3% to 7.22 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, while in the Ampol-House-View baseline they fall to 9.32 Mt CO₂-e (‑34.6%). By 2050, total built environment emissions in the baseline are 9.3 Mt CO₂-e higher than in the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, highlighting the additional abatement opportunity in residential buildings through accelerated electrification, higher efficiency standards and deeper retrofit activity.

Residential building production increases steadily across the projection horizon, with both dwelling numbers and associated floor area expanding materially to 2050. This growth, shown alongside the commercial sector, underscores the decoupling of energy and emissions from physical expansion: even as the residential stock grows, total energy use is broadly flat and emissions fall sharply in the decarbonisation scenarios. This implies a sustained improvement in the energy intensity of new homes and major renovations, consistent with tightening building codes and higher appliance performance standards discussed elsewhere in this report.

Commercial energy demand in buildings increases across all scenarios, driven by ongoing growth in floor area and service intensity. From a common 2025 baseline of 276.5 PJ, total commercial buildings energy use rises by 52.4% to 421.4 PJ in **Ampol-1.5DS** (1.5°C‑aligned pathway) and by 34.3% to 371.5 PJ in **Ampol-2.5DS** (2.5°C pathway) by 2050. The **Ampol‑House‑View** (reference/baseline scenario) sits between these pathways, reaching 379.9 PJ by 2050. By mid‑century, commercial energy use in Ampol‑1.5DS is 49.9 PJ higher than in Ampol‑2.5DS, reflecting more extensive electrification and higher economic activity. Across all scenarios, electricity becomes increasingly dominant in the commercial fuel mix, while direct use of fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) contracts and low‑carbon fuels such as biomethane and hydrogen emerge but remain relatively small contributors by 2050.

*Figure: Projected commercial buildings final energy use by fuel under the three scenarios, showing growth in total demand and progressive electrification of the sector.*

Despite rising energy consumption, associated emissions from the built environment decline substantially as the power system decarbonises and direct fossil fuel use in buildings falls. In Ampol‑1.5DS, total built environment emissions (residential plus commercial) fall from 14.25 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to zero by 2050, implying that commercial buildings effectively achieve net‑zero operational emissions. Under Ampol‑2.5DS, emissions fall by 49.3% to 7.22 Mt CO₂‑e, while in Ampol‑House‑View they decline by 34.6% to 9.32 Mt CO₂‑e. By 2050, the reference pathway is therefore 9.3 Mt CO₂‑e higher than the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway, highlighting the importance of stronger efficiency measures, fuel switching and grid decarbonisation in the commercial segment. Within the total, the commercial share remains material, particularly in the less ambitious scenarios, underscoring the sector’s role in meeting economy‑wide targets discussed in the overarching emissions section.

*Figure: Built environment emissions by subsector under each scenario, illustrating the steep decline to net zero in Ampol‑1.5DS and the slower reductions in Ampol‑2.5DS and Ampol‑House‑View.*

Growth in commercial energy demand is closely linked to the expansion of the commercial building stock. Commercial floor area in operation approximately doubles over 2025–2050, rising from just under 0.5 billion m² to slightly above 1.0 billion m², outpacing the growth in commercial energy use. This implies an improvement in energy intensity (energy use per square metre), consistent with tightening building standards, retrofits and more efficient equipment. The divergence between rising floorspace and moderating energy growth is most pronounced under Ampol‑1.5DS, aligning with the stronger efficiency and electrification assumptions for the sector.

Agricultural energy demand remains relatively stable over the projection period, with only modest changes in total final energy use across scenarios compared with other sectors. From a common starting point of 107.69 PJ in 2025, total agricultural energy consumption in the **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5°C-aligned pathway) falls to 88.75 PJ by 2050, a 17.6% reduction. Under the **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5°C pathway), energy use declines by 7.5% to 99.56 PJ, while in the **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario) it decreases slightly to 101.1 PJ (–6.1%). By 2050, the reference pathway therefore uses 12.3 PJ more energy than the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, underscoring the additional efficiency and structural change required for deep decarbonisation.

![Agriculture Energy Use by Fuel](figures/agriculture_energy_use_by_fuel.png)  
*Figure: Projected agricultural final energy use by fuel and scenario, 2025–2050.*

All scenarios show a progressive shift in the fuel mix away from diesel, with the fastest transition in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway. In this scenario, diesel consumption falls sharply over time, with electricity and bioenergy (including biomethane) taking an increasing share of on‑farm energy demand. Natural gas plays a relatively minor role throughout. The Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View pathways exhibit a slower diversification, with diesel remaining the dominant fuel in 2050 but with incremental gains in electricity and limited uptake of biomethane. These changes imply growing importance of rural electricity supply, charging infrastructure and bioenergy supply chains to support low‑emissions agricultural operations.

The evolution of energy use is closely linked to the agriculture and land-use emissions outlook. Net agriculture and land-use emissions fall from 9.49 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to substantial net sinks of –70.26 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050 under Ampol-1p5DS and –91.57 Mt CO₂‑e under Ampol-2p5DS. In contrast, under Ampol-House-View, net emissions rise to 43.06 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050, such that the reference pathway is 134.6 Mt CO₂‑e higher than the 2.5°C pathway at the end of the period. The stronger net negative outcomes in the decarbonisation scenarios are driven primarily by expanded sequestration and non‑energy land management practices, with energy efficiency and fuel switching providing complementary emissions reductions.

![Agriculture and Land Use Emissions](figures/agriculture_and_land_use_emissions.png)  
*Figure: Agriculture and land-use gross emissions, sequestration and net emissions by scenario, 2025–2050.*

Abatement potential from non‑energy agricultural processes is significant. Cumulative process abatement in 2050 reaches –24.99 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-1p5DS and –22.11 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS, compared with –9.93 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-House-View. The majority of this abatement is associated with methane mitigation in sheep and cattle, with additional contributions from dairy methane reduction and precision agriculture technologies. By 2050, the reference scenario delivers 15.1 Mt CO₂‑e less process abatement than the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, highlighting the scale-up required in low‑emissions livestock and farming practices to complement energy-side measures.
