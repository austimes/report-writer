Industrial final energy demand declines materially across all scenarios, while emissions fall more rapidly as fuel switching and process changes take effect. Total industry energy use is projected to fall from 1,555 PJ in 2025 to between 1,089 PJ (Ampol-2p5DS, 2.5°C pathway) and 1,179 PJ (Ampol-1p5DS, 1.5°C‑aligned pathway) by 2050, a reduction of 24–30%. The reference/baseline scenario Ampol-House-View is similar, reaching 1,164 PJ by 2050 (‑25.2%). Despite comparable aggregate reductions, the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway maintains around 90 PJ more industrial energy use than the 2.5°C pathway in 2050, reflecting higher residual activity and deeper electrification.

The fuel mix shifts markedly over the projection period. Across all scenarios, the reliance on natural gas and coal in industry declines, displaced by electricity, biomass, emerging low‑emission fuels and direct electrification technologies. This is most pronounced in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway, where stronger decarbonisation of heat and processes leads to faster reductions in fossil fuel use but maintains overall energy requirements due to efficiency penalties associated with some low‑emissions technologies. These fuel‑mix changes are consistent with the broader electrification trends highlighted in other sectors of this report.

The iron and steel subsector illustrates the divergence between pathways. Starting from 98.7 PJ in 2025, iron and steel energy use grows to 166.1 PJ by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS, a 68.3% increase, driven by a transition toward electricity, natural gas and hydrogen-based production routes. By contrast, energy use falls sharply to 28.5 PJ in Ampol-2p5DS (‑71.1%) and to 68.9 PJ in Ampol-House-View (‑30.2%), indicating lower production volumes and slower adoption of new technologies relative to the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway.

While energy use falls moderately, industrial greenhouse gas emissions decline much more steeply, underscoring the importance of decarbonising fuels and processes. Aggregate industry emissions fall from 146.8 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to 37.0 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (‑74.8%), and to 49.8 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS (‑66.1%). Under Ampol-House-View, emissions decline less, to 74.4 Mt CO₂‑e (‑49.3%), leaving 2050 emissions 37.4 Mt CO₂‑e higher than in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway. The sharper reductions in Ampol-1p5DS reflect faster phase‑out of fossil fuels, process changes in emissions‑intensive subsectors and earlier deployment of low‑emissions technologies, with only limited contributions from captured emissions.

Within manufacturing, emissions reductions are substantial in the decarbonisation pathways but more muted in the reference case. Total manufacturing emissions fall from 61.0 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to 24.6 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 in Ampol-1p5DS (‑59.7%) and to 31.3 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS (‑48.7%). In contrast, the Ampol-House-View scenario records only a modest decline to 51.0 Mt CO₂‑e (‑16.4%), remaining 26.4 Mt CO₂‑e above the 1.5°C‑aligned outcome in 2050. The largest absolute reductions occur in iron and steel, alumina and cement, where a combination of fuel switching, efficiency and process innovation materially lowers emissions. Other subsectors, such as food and beverages and paper products, see smaller but still meaningful declines, primarily through improved efficiency and increased electrification.

Carbon capture in the chemical sector plays a limited but distinct role. In Ampol-2p5DS, captured emissions from chemical processes reach around 1.0 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050 (net emissions of ‑1.04 Mt CO₂‑e), with capture applied to coal and natural‑gas‑based production routes and urea production. This contrasts with the Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-House-View scenarios, where chemical sector captured emissions remain close to zero by 2050. As a result, 2050 chemical captured emissions in Ampol-House-View are around 1.0 Mt CO₂‑e higher (i.e. less negative) than in Ampol-2p5DS.

Overall, the industrial sector’s projections indicate that deep emissions reductions are achievable with only moderate declines in total energy use, provided there is sustained investment in electrification, fuel switching and process innovation—particularly in hard‑to‑abate subsectors such as iron and steel, alumina and cement.
