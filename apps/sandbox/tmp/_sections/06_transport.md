Domestic transport is a major driver of final energy demand, and the scenarios show a wide divergence in long‑term outcomes. In the Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway), total domestic transport energy use declines from 1,447 PJ in 2025 to 840 PJ in 2050, a 42% reduction. Under Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway), demand falls more moderately to 1,081 PJ by 2050 (–25.3%), while in Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario) overall domestic transport energy remains effectively flat, ending at 1,450 PJ (+0.2%). By 2050, this leaves domestic transport in Ampol-House-View consuming around 610 PJ more energy than in Ampol-1p5DS.

Road transport, the largest subsector, accounts for most of this change. In Ampol-1p5DS, road transport energy demand halves over the projection period, falling from 1,177 PJ in 2025 to 557 PJ in 2050 (–52.7%). Ampol-2p5DS shows a smaller decline to 675 PJ (–42.6%), whereas Ampol-House-View only reduces road energy demand to 1,068 PJ by 2050 (–9.3%). As a result, road transport energy use in 2050 is about 510 PJ higher in Ampol-House-View than in Ampol-1p5DS. Across the decarbonisation scenarios, oil-based fuels (diesel and petrol) contract sharply and are progressively replaced by electricity, biofuels and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen.

The evolution of new vehicle sales underpins these energy trajectories. In Ampol-1p5DS, combustion engine vehicles rapidly lose market share, with battery electric drivetrains (including long-range and autonomous electric vehicles) dominating new sales by the late 2030s. Ampol-2p5DS exhibits a slower but still material shift, with combustion engines persisting in a non-trivial share of sales into the 2040s. In contrast, Ampol-House-View retains a high proportion of internal combustion engine sales through to 2050, with low penetration of zero-emissions drivetrains. These differences in technology uptake directly drive the pace of fuel switching and efficiency gains in road transport.

Changes in fleet composition lag changes in new sales but follow a similar pattern. Under Ampol-1p5DS, the stock of combustion engine vehicles declines steadily as electrified and fuel cell vehicles diffuse through the fleet, reaching a predominantly zero-emissions road vehicle stock by 2050. Ampol-2p5DS still achieves a substantial shift away from combustion engines but retains a sizeable share of legacy vehicles at mid‑century. Under Ampol-House-View, combustion engine vehicles remain the dominant share of the road fleet in 2050, constraining reductions in both energy demand and emissions.

The combined effect of reduced energy demand and fuel switching is reflected in domestic transport emissions. In Ampol-1p5DS, domestic transport emissions fall from 98.1 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to just 4.0 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, a 95.9% reduction, with all subsectors—including passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, trucks and aviation—converging towards very low emissions. Ampol-2p5DS achieves a 55.7% decline to 43.4 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050, while Ampol-House-View delivers only a 21.4% reduction to 77.1 Mt CO₂‑e. The gap between Ampol-House-View and Ampol-1p5DS reaches 73.1 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, underlining the critical role of rapid transport decarbonisation in meeting economy-wide emissions objectives discussed in the emissions section of this report.
