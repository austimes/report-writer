Projected emissions trajectories diverge materially across the three scenarios, all of which start from the same 2025 net emissions level of 401.05 Mt CO₂‑e. Under the Ampol‑1p5DS (1.5°C‑aligned pathway), total abatement over the projection period reaches 472.53 Mt CO₂‑e, with the largest contributions from Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂‑e), Industry (‑109.74 Mt CO₂‑e) and Transport (‑94.07 Mt CO₂‑e). The Ampol‑2p5DS (2.5°C pathway) also relies heavily on Power Generation (‑128.92 Mt CO₂‑e) but allocates a greater share of reductions to Land Use (‑101.06 Mt CO₂‑e). In contrast, the Ampol‑House‑View (reference/baseline scenario) delivers more modest cuts (total reduction of 195.63 Mt CO₂‑e), with Power Generation (‑127.83 Mt CO₂‑e) and Industry (‑72.37 Mt CO₂‑e) partly offset by a net increase in Land Use emissions of 33.58 Mt CO₂‑e.

These sectoral shifts translate into significantly different net emissions outcomes by 2050. In the Ampol‑1p5DS scenario, total net emissions fall from 401.05 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to ‑71.48 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies the economy becomes a net sink by mid‑century. The Ampol‑2p5DS pathway approaches net zero, reducing emissions by 99.1% to 3.52 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050. Under Ampol‑House‑View, progress is slower: net emissions decline by 48.8% to 205.41 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050. As a result, 2050 emissions in the reference/baseline scenario are 276.9 Mt CO₂‑e higher than in the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway, underscoring the scale of additional decarbonisation required to align with a 1.5°C outcome.

Achieving the deeper emissions cuts in Ampol‑1p5DS and Ampol‑2p5DS is closely linked to accelerated electrification. Total electricity consumption rises from 355.36 TWh in 2025 to 1,019.51 TWh in 2050 under Ampol‑1p5DS, an increase of 186.9%. The Ampol‑2p5DS scenario records a 119.7% increase to 780.55 TWh, while Ampol‑House‑View grows by 102.5% to 719.75 TWh. By 2050, electricity demand in Ampol‑1p5DS is 299.8 TWh higher than in the reference/baseline scenario, reflecting greater substitution of fossil fuels with low‑emissions electricity across transport, industry and buildings. These projections highlight the dual requirement of rapidly decarbonising power generation and expanding electricity supply to support economy‑wide emissions reductions.
