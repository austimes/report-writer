Across all scenarios, total final energy consumption shifts markedly towards electricity and low‑emissions fuels, even as aggregate industrial energy use declines over the projection period.

Total electricity consumption across sectors rises from 355.36 TWh in 2025 to 1,019.51 TWh in 2050 under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway)**, an increase of 186.9%. The **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway)** and **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** show more moderate growth, reaching 780.55 TWh (+119.7%) and 719.75 TWh (+102.5%) respectively by 2050. By the end of the outlook period, electricity demand in Ampol-1p5DS is 299.8 TWh higher than in Ampol-House-View, reflecting deeper electrification of transport, buildings and industry, and additional load from emerging sectors such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide removal.

In contrast to the strong growth in electricity demand, total final energy use in industry declines in all scenarios. From a common 2025 baseline of 1,555.51 PJ, industrial energy consumption falls to 1,179.22 PJ in 2050 in **Ampol-1p5DS** (a 24.2% reduction), 1,089.19 PJ in **Ampol-2p5DS** (‑30.0%), and 1,164.28 PJ in **Ampol-House-View** (‑25.2%). The steeper reduction in Ampol-2p5DS reflects more pronounced efficiency gains and fuel savings, while the slightly higher 2050 level in Ampol-1p5DS (90.0 PJ above Ampol-2p5DS) is associated with increased use of electricity, hydrogen and other low‑carbon fuels to support deeper emissions abatement.
