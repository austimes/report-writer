Commercial energy demand in buildings increases across all scenarios, driven by ongoing growth in floor area and service intensity. From a common 2025 baseline of 276.5 PJ, total commercial buildings energy use rises by 52.4% to 421.4 PJ in **Ampol-1.5DS** (1.5°C‑aligned pathway) and by 34.3% to 371.5 PJ in **Ampol-2.5DS** (2.5°C pathway) by 2050. The **Ampol‑House‑View** (reference/baseline scenario) sits between these pathways, reaching 379.9 PJ by 2050. By mid‑century, commercial energy use in Ampol‑1.5DS is 49.9 PJ higher than in Ampol‑2.5DS, reflecting more extensive electrification and higher economic activity. Across all scenarios, electricity becomes increasingly dominant in the commercial fuel mix, while direct use of fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) contracts and low‑carbon fuels such as biomethane and hydrogen emerge but remain relatively small contributors by 2050.

Despite rising energy consumption, associated emissions from the built environment decline substantially as the power system decarbonises and direct fossil fuel use in buildings falls. In Ampol‑1.5DS, total built environment emissions (residential plus commercial) fall from 14.25 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to zero by 2050, implying that commercial buildings effectively achieve net‑zero operational emissions. Under Ampol‑2.5DS, emissions fall by 49.3% to 7.22 Mt CO₂‑e, while in Ampol‑House‑View they decline by 34.6% to 9.32 Mt CO₂‑e. By 2050, the reference pathway is therefore 9.3 Mt CO₂‑e higher than the 1.5°C‑aligned pathway, highlighting the importance of stronger efficiency measures, fuel switching and grid decarbonisation in the commercial segment. Within the total, the commercial share remains material, particularly in the less ambitious scenarios, underscoring the sector’s role in meeting economy‑wide targets discussed in the overarching emissions section.

Growth in commercial energy demand is closely linked to the expansion of the commercial building stock. Commercial floor area in operation approximately doubles over 2025–2050, rising from just under 0.5 billion m² to slightly above 1.0 billion m², outpacing the growth in commercial energy use. This implies an improvement in energy intensity (energy use per square metre), consistent with tightening building standards, retrofits and more efficient equipment. The divergence between rising floorspace and moderating energy growth is most pronounced under Ampol‑1.5DS, aligning with the stronger efficiency and electrification assumptions for the sector.
