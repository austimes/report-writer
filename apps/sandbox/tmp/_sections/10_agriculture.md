Agricultural energy demand remains relatively stable over the projection period, with only modest changes in total final energy use across scenarios compared with other sectors. From a common starting point of 107.69 PJ in 2025, total agricultural energy consumption in the **Ampol-1p5DS** (1.5°C-aligned pathway) falls to 88.75 PJ by 2050, a 17.6% reduction. Under the **Ampol-2p5DS** (2.5°C pathway), energy use declines by 7.5% to 99.56 PJ, while in the **Ampol-House-View** (reference/baseline scenario) it decreases slightly to 101.1 PJ (–6.1%). By 2050, the reference pathway therefore uses 12.3 PJ more energy than the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, underscoring the additional efficiency and structural change required for deep decarbonisation.

All scenarios show a progressive shift in the fuel mix away from diesel, with the fastest transition in the Ampol-1p5DS pathway. In this scenario, diesel consumption falls sharply over time, with electricity and bioenergy (including biomethane) taking an increasing share of on‑farm energy demand. Natural gas plays a relatively minor role throughout. The Ampol-2p5DS and Ampol-House-View pathways exhibit a slower diversification, with diesel remaining the dominant fuel in 2050 but with incremental gains in electricity and limited uptake of biomethane. These changes imply growing importance of rural electricity supply, charging infrastructure and bioenergy supply chains to support low‑emissions agricultural operations.

The evolution of energy use is closely linked to the agriculture and land-use emissions outlook. Net agriculture and land-use emissions fall from 9.49 Mt CO₂‑e in 2025 to substantial net sinks of –70.26 Mt CO₂‑e in 2050 under Ampol-1p5DS and –91.57 Mt CO₂‑e under Ampol-2p5DS. In contrast, under Ampol-House-View, net emissions rise to 43.06 Mt CO₂‑e by 2050, such that the reference pathway is 134.6 Mt CO₂‑e higher than the 2.5°C pathway at the end of the period. The stronger net negative outcomes in the decarbonisation scenarios are driven primarily by expanded sequestration and non‑energy land management practices, with energy efficiency and fuel switching providing complementary emissions reductions.

Abatement potential from non‑energy agricultural processes is significant. Cumulative process abatement in 2050 reaches –24.99 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-1p5DS and –22.11 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-2p5DS, compared with –9.93 Mt CO₂‑e in Ampol-House-View. The majority of this abatement is associated with methane mitigation in sheep and cattle, with additional contributions from dairy methane reduction and precision agriculture technologies. By 2050, the reference scenario delivers 15.1 Mt CO₂‑e less process abatement than the 1.5°C-aligned pathway, highlighting the scale-up required in low‑emissions livestock and farming practices to complement energy-side measures.
