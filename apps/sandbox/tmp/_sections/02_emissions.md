Total national emissions across all scenarios start from a common baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e in 2025. Under **Ampol-1p5DS (1.5°C-aligned pathway)**, net emissions fall to -71.48 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, a 117.8% reduction that implies net-negative emissions driven by large-scale removals and land sector sequestration. **Ampol-2p5DS (2.5°C pathway)** approaches net zero by 2050, reaching 3.52 Mt CO₂-e (a 99.1% reduction). In contrast, **Ampol-House-View (reference/baseline scenario)** only reduces emissions by 48.8%, to 205.41 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, leaving a 276.9 Mt CO₂-e gap to Ampol-1p5DS.

The distribution of reductions across sectors differs materially between scenarios. From the 2025 baseline of 401.05 Mt CO₂-e, **Ampol-1p5DS** delivers the largest overall cut, with cumulative sectoral changes totalling -472.53 Mt CO₂-e by 2050. Power generation is the single largest contributor (-128.92 Mt CO₂-e), followed by industry (-109.74 Mt CO₂-e) and transport (-94.07 Mt CO₂-e). **Ampol-2p5DS** achieves -397.51 Mt CO₂-e of total reductions, with power generation again dominant (-128.92 Mt CO₂-e) but a greater role for land use (-101.06 Mt CO₂-e). Under **Ampol-House-View**, aggregate reductions are more modest at -195.63 Mt CO₂-e; power generation still provides a substantial -127.83 Mt CO₂-e, but this is partly offset by a net increase in land use emissions of +33.58 Mt CO₂-e.

Decarbonisation of electricity generation is rapid in all scenarios, but most complete under Ampol-1p5DS and Ampol-2p5DS. From 129.87 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, power sector emissions fall by 99.3% to 0.94 Mt CO₂-e in Ampol-1p5DS and to 0.95 Mt CO₂-e in Ampol-2p5DS by 2050. Ampol-House-View retains slightly higher residual emissions of 2.04 Mt CO₂-e in 2050 (a 98.4% reduction), leaving a 1.1 Mt CO₂-e gap to the 1.5°C-aligned pathway.

Transport is a key area of divergence. Starting from 98.07 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** reduces domestic transport emissions by 95.9% to 4.0 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, reflecting deep electrification and fuel switching across road, rail, aviation and shipping. Under **Ampol-2p5DS**, transport emissions fall more modestly, by 55.7% to 43.42 Mt CO₂-e. **Ampol-House-View** sees only a 21.4% reduction, with transport emissions still at 77.06 Mt CO₂-e in 2050—73.1 Mt CO₂-e higher than under Ampol-1p5DS—indicating slower uptake of low‑emissions mobility options.

Emissions from the built environment (residential and commercial buildings) show similar patterns. From 14.25 Mt CO₂-e in 2025, **Ampol-1p5DS** achieves full decarbonisation of buildings by 2050 (0.0 Mt CO₂-e), consistent with widespread electrification and efficiency improvements. **Ampol-2p5DS** halves built environment emissions, to 7.22 Mt CO₂-e (a 49.3% reduction), while **Ampol-House-View** achieves a 34.6% reduction, to 9.32 Mt CO₂-e. The 2050 gap between the reference pathway and Ampol-1p5DS is 9.3 Mt CO₂-e.

Together, these projections show that achieving a 1.5°C-aligned outcome relies on near-complete decarbonisation of power, transport and buildings, combined with significant industrial abatement and net removals from land use and engineered carbon dioxide removal. The reference pathway leaves substantial residual emissions in 2050 across these sectors, underscoring the scale of additional action required beyond business-as-usual.
