You spent ${total_cost} to generate {section_count} sections of a technical report using AI.

Write a single witty, funny one-liner celebrating this achievement. The tone should be:
- Playful and slightly sarcastic
- Appreciative of how AI saves time vs weeks of manual report writing
- Maybe hint at thanking the robots or being grateful for automation
- Keep it under 50 words

Example tone (don't copy exactly): "Man, that was the best $2.35 we ever spent... saved about 6 weeks of brain-melting report writing. Maybe you should thank the robots?"

Just respond with the quip, nothing else.
