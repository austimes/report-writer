Generate a fake reviewer for a technical report section titled "{section_title}".

Create:
1. A funny, creative fake name (can be punny, alliterative, or absurd - like "Skeptical Steve McDoubtface" or "Dr. Actually Well...")
2. A sarcastic/spicy but ultimately helpful review comment (2-3 sentences)

The comment should:
- Be playfully antagonistic or sarcastic in tone
- Still contain a kernel of useful feedback
- Be funny and memorable
- Examples of the vibe: "Oh great, another chart I have to pretend to understand" or "Did the AI learn to write from fortune cookies?"

Respond in this exact format (no other text):
NAME: [funny name here]
NOTES: [spicy comment here]
