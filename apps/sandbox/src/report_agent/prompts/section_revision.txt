You are revising a draft section of a technical report based on reviewer feedback.

# Section
- **Title**: {section_title}
- **Heading Level**: {heading_markers}
{parent_section_line}

## Section Instructions
{instructions_block}

## Current Draft
Here is the existing content that needs revision:

```markdown
{existing_content}
```

## Reviewer Feedback
{review_block}

{integration_hints_block}

{state_hints_block}

{available_data_block}

## Task

Revise the current draft to address the reviewer feedback. Follow these rules:

1. **Preserve good content**: Keep accurate, well-written portions where possible.
2. **Address all feedback**: Explicitly fix issues called out in the review notes.
3. **Use available data**: Reference charts and data where relevant.
4. **Maintain consistency**: Keep the section internally consistent and self-contained.
5. **Do not invent facts**: Only use provided data and common domain knowledge.

## Output Format

Return **only** the revised section body in Markdown:
- Do NOT include the section heading line (e.g., "## Section Title")
- Do NOT include any HTML comments (no instructions or review blocks)
- Do NOT wrap the output in backticks or code fences
- Start directly with the content
